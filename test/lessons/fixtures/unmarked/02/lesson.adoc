title: "What is the Internet?"
---

The internet is multiple things.
//
It is a network of computers that are _connected_ together, mainly with wires
but also with wireless connections--particularly at the edge.
//
The word "internet" is short for an inter-network, or a network of networks.
//
It is also a set of _protocols_ that define how these connected computers
communicate with each other.
//
Without agreements such as the Internet Protocol (IP), it would be impossible
for the connected computers on the internet to work together.
//
Finally, the internet is a _transformative_ technology.
//
It is changing every aspects of our lives and even altering the way that we
think.
//
We will approach the internet on all three levels: physical, protocol, and
phenomenon.
