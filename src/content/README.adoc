= Content Directory Layout

The contents of this directory are used to build static site components.
//
The directory is organized by contributor email address.
//
Contributions will be automatically tagged using this email address.
//
So the contents of `content/challen@buffalo.edu/basics/` will be listed as
contributed by challen@buffalo.edu.

Directory layout below the email address subdirectory is mostly up to the
contributor, with a few constraints.
//
The build process will find all `lesson.adoc` files and attach the metadata
and summary they contain to all files in the same subdirectory and below.
//
As a result, each `lesson.adoc` file must be in its own subdirectory.
//
The build process will check for this and complain if needed.
