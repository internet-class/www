title: "Why discuss the internet?"
---

Because the internet is awesome!
//
It is the most transformative technology of our age.
//
It is changing every aspect of our lives--how we communicate, date, shop,
learn, play, love, commute, and insert any other action verb here.
//
Like other transformative technologies like

http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/10/21/head-count-3[chemical
fertilizer], and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press[the printing
press], the internet is even changing _how we think_.
//
It will probably shape human evolution.
//
And we've only connected
//

//
with arguably the more interesting 4 billion users left to go.
//
But the internet already allows you to communicate with 3 billion people.
//
Think about that for a second.
//
How else can you write something that 3 billion people could read?
//
When historians look back on our time, I believe that they will refer to it as
the "Internet Era".

So the internet matters to everyone.
//
But if you are a computer scientist or curious about computer science, you
care about the internet even more.
//
The internet is our proudest accomplishment and puts on display some of our
best work.
//
It integrates contributions from every
//
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_computer_science[subfield of computer
science]:
//
networking (duh), algorithms, coding theory, artificial intelligence, language
processing, data mining, scientific computing, and literally everything else.
//
It's all there, and it all plays a role in making the internet what it is.
//

If you plan on building software in the future, a lot of your best work will
be online too.
//
How else can you deploy a new idea instantly to 3 billion people?
//
Think about that for a second.
//
You can write software that 3 billion people will be able to use, instantly.
//
That's incredible.
//
And as the world of software continues to collapse into the web browser, more
of the apps that you build will be web apps and more of the interfaces will be
web interfaces.

And if that wasn't enough, the internet also embodies a lot of deep computer
science design principles.
//
Some decisions that made the internet so successful were the result of luck.
//
Others were great design.
//
But the fact that the internet works as well as it does and has served as such
an effective driver of innovation is testament to the effectiveness of core
internet design principles.
