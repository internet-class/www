== Overview

[.lead]
This course is an introduction to operating system design and implementation.
We study operating systems because they are examples of mature and elegant
solutions to a difficult design problem: how to safely and efficiently share
system resources and provide abstractions useful to applications.

For the processor, memory, and disks, we discuss how the operating system
allocates each resource and explore the design and implementation of related
abstractions. We also establish techniques for testing and improving system
performance and introduce the idea of hardware virtualization. Programming
assignments provide hands-on experience with implementing core operating
system components in a realistic development environment.

== Description

Operating systems are the masterworks of the programming world: beautiful and
sophisticated solutions to difficult design problems that have emerged from
years of effort by thousands of skilled programmers. Just like budding
artists study the works of the great masters for inspiration, we programmers
study operating systems. While most of you will never contribute a single
line of code to a production operating system, we hope that by the end of the
course you will have learned something from their elegance and maturity.

Understanding operating system design will make you a better software
engineer, and struggling with operating system programming will make you a
better programmer. This course gives you a chance to do both. We establish a
_conceptual_ track through lectures and exams, where we discuss the concepts
and design principles of modern operating systems and how hardware devices
such as the CPU, memory, and disks are multiplexed and abstracted. Equally
important, however, is the _programming_ track which proceeds through four
assignments that give you the chance to implement core operating system
functionality in a simplified development environment. After studying
synchronization, you will implement synchronization primitives. After
studying the system call interface, you will implement it. After studying
virtual memory and address translation, you will design and implement a
virtual memory subsystem.

Designing and implementing operating system concepts is not easy, and neither
is this course. But we are here to help and committed to providing you with
the support you need to succeed. Our online grading tools provide helpful
feedback and allow you to repeatedly test and submit your assignments until
you earn the grade you desire. And our TAs are experienced and will be
available for many hours each week to provide individual help. We expect that
you will find this course difficult, but we hope you will also learn a large
amount, have fun, and develop a passion for computer systems.

=== ABET Outcomes

The http://www.abet.org[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology
(ABET)] helps guide curriculum by defining common outcomes that coursework
should help students achieve by the time they graduate. This course should
assist you in four of the nine University at Buffalo outcomes:

. *(c)* An ability to design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system,
process, component, or program to meet desired needs.
. *(d)* An ability to function effectively on teams to accomplish a common
goal.
. *(f)* An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences.
. *(i)* An ability to use current techniques, skills, and tools necessary for
computing practice.
. *(k)* An ability to apply design and development principles in the
construction of software systems of varying complexity.

The table below describes how each outcome above is incorporated into this
course:

[cols="^2,8",options='header']

| ABET a--k
| Description

| *c*
| All four assignments challenge your ability to _"design, implement, and
evaluate"_ components of an operating system.

| *d*
| All four programming assignments are performed in pairs, helping you
_"function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal"_.

| *f*
| Preparing design documents is an integral part of the two large
assignments, providing practice at effective technical communication, part of
the ability to _"communicate effectively with a range of audiences"_.

| *i*
| This course requires students to develop in a virtual machine, use
http://git-scm.com/[Git] for collaborative development, and use modern
debugging and code editing tools, all preparing you to _"use current
techniques, skills, and tools necessary for computing practice"_.

| *k*
| The course assignments increase in complexity as the semester goes on,
allowing students to _"apply design and development principles in the
construction of software systems of varying complexity"_.

=== Programming Assignments

The course includes four programming assignments of increasing difficulty.
The assignments themselves are hosted on this website.  You also use the
website to submit your answers and view your grades. The programming portions
of the assignment are graded automatically and you may submit them as often as
you like, using the autograder output to improve your submission. Questions
that are graded by the course staff may be submitted twice, since they must be
graded each time. Each question also has a rubric which indicates exactly how
each portion of the question was evaluated and points assigned.

All programming assignments are done in pairs. *Both students in each pair
receive the same grade for each programming assignment.* Each programming
assignment also has specific collaboration guidelines that you must indicate
you have followed each time you submit answers.

A description of each assignment along with due dates are listed below. This
year we expect these to be firm and *no extensions will be given.*

==== link:/asst/0/[`ASST0`: Introduction to OS/161]

Introduces you to the programming environment you will be working in this
semester, including the OS/161 operating system, the `sys161` simulator, the
GNU debugger (GDB), and the Git revision control system.  Consists of code
reading questions, a few simple scripting tasks, and a very simple
implementation task.

==== link:/asst/1/[`ASST1`: Synchronization]

*Deadline*: Monday 2/22/2016 @ 5PM.

Your first real taste of kernel programming. After completing a set of code
reading questions, you implement locks, condition variables and reader-writer
locks. Next, you use them to solve a few simple toy synchronization problems.

==== link:/asst/2/[`ASST2`: System Calls and Process Support]

*Deadline*: Friday 3/11/2016 @ 11:59PM.

The first big and complex assignment. Start by completing a design that
indicates you understand all of the moving pieces and what to do. Next,
implement the system call interface. When you are finished, your kernel should
be able to run user programs.

==== link:/asst/3/[`ASST3`: Virtual Memory]

The mountain top. A large amount of code to implement and many internal
interfaces to design. As always, start with a careful design. Then implement
virtual memory, including address translation, TLB management, page
replacement and swapping. When you are finished, your kernel should be able to
run forever without running out of memory, and you will have completed the
course.

This year we are splitting the link:/asst/3/[ASST3,role='hidden_print'] deadlines into three parts:

. *ASST3.1*: working core map. *Deadline*: Friday 4/8/2016 @ 5PM.
. *ASST3.2*: user paging. *Deadline*: Friday 4/22/2016 @ 5PM.
. *ASST3.3*: swapping. *Deadline*: Friday 5/6/2016 @ 5PM.

==== Extra credit

This year we will provide up to 5% extra credit to students that help us
improve our course materials. All the assignments and lecture slides, as well
as other resources including our Vagrant virtual machine configuration and the
`test161` OS/161 testing tool, are online at our
https://github.com/ops-class[`ops-class.org` GitHub repository]. The amount of
extra credit that will be provided will be commensurate with your contribution
and completely at the discretion of the course staff.

To take advantage of this offer you must also present your updates to the
course staff in a way that makes them straightforward to incorporate. Do not
email us, or post in the forum. Clone our repository, fix the problem, and send
us a pull request. If you are curious about how much credit a particular change
will earn you, post it as an issue on GitHub first and we'll discuss.

=== Incomplete Grades

Please refer to the
http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/grading/explanation.shtml#incomplete[undergraduate]
or
http://grad.buffalo.edu/Academics/Policies-Procedures/Grading-Procedures.html#incomplete[graduate]
incomplete policy as appropriate. Of particular importance is this language
from the undergraduate incomplete policy (the graduate language is similar):

[quote]
Students may only be given an *I* grade if they have a passing average in
coursework that has been completed and have well-defined parameters to
complete the course requirements that could result in a grade better than the
default grade. _An *I* grade may not be assigned to a student who
  did not attend the course._

Note that for graduate students, "the default grade accompanying an interim
grade of *I* shall be *U* and will be displayed on the UB record as
[.spelling_exception]*IU*."

=== Academic Integrity

Please review the http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/shared/policies/academic.php[CSE
Department academic integrity policy] and the UB
http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.shtml[undergraduate]
or http://grad.buffalo.edu/study/progress/policies.html#preamble[graduate]
academic integrity policy as appropriate to familiarize yourself with the
relevant academic integrity policies and procedures. In general, the rule of
thumb is that talking _about_ code in English is OK, but talking _in_ or
_exchanging_ code is cheating. Each assignment has specific guidelines about
what types of collaboration are encouraged, discouraged, and forbidden. We
will use automated plagiarism detection software to check every submission
against solutions submitted in prior years as well as all publicly-available
solutions online.

*Students that submit plagiarized work will receive a grade of F for the
course.*

=== Disabilities

Please register and coordinate with the Office of Disability Services. Let
the course staff know when accommodations need to be made. We are committed
to helping you learn.

== Getting Help

The operating systems programming assignments are difficult and most students
require a fair amount of help during the semester. Here's how to--and how
not to--get help.

=== Great Ways to Get Help

* *Use the https://discourse.ops-class.org[the forum].* This is by far your
best resource because it allows you to get help from anyone--not just a TA or
Ninja--at any time--not just during office hours. Please use and contribute
to this valuable shared resource.

* *Come to office hours.* We don't hold them for our health and
the staff gets bored when there isn't anyone to help! So please don't
hesitate to come in. Office hours are also a great time to work on your
assignments, since if (when) you get stuck help is already nearby.

=== Bad Ways to Get Help

* *Emailing any staff member using their `@buffalo.edu` email address.* I
instruct the staff to ignore these emails and I will as well.

* Emailing mailto:staff@ops-class.org[`staff@ops-class.org`].
This address is only for administrative uses, not for getting help on
assignments.

* Emailing mailto:prof@ops-class.org[`prof@ops-class.org`].
This address is only for highly-sensitive administrative uses, not for
getting help on assignments.

=== Forum

We are using a https://discourse.ops-class.org[Discourse forum] this semester
for all class-related communications. Please update your profile on it and use
it for all lecture- and assignment-related Q&A.

Before we got tired of it and it's strange approach to pedagogy we used
Piazza in past years. Unfortunately, there seems to be no way to make the
previous forums contents public footnote:[Yet another thing to dislike about
Piazza...].

=== Mailing List

All enrolled students will be added to a mailing list which we will use for
course communication. *You are responsible for email messages sent to this
list.* If you are not enrolled and would like to be added to the list, you can
