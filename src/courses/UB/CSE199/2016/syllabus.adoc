== Overview

The internet is changing every aspect of our lives, including how we
communicate, learn, navigate, organize, work, play, and love.
//
The internet also represents a crowning achievement of computing: a single
system uniting hardware and software, theory and implementation, standards
and innovation, engineering and science, protests that topple governments and
stupid cat videos.
//
This course provides an overview of how the internet works by describing
everything required to answer a single search query.
//
Along with its technologies, we will delve into the internetâ€™s past and
future, policy challenges, and societal implications.
//
The course is targeted at a general audience, but because the internet
reflects contributions from many areas of computer science and computer
engineering, it also provides a good overview for potential majors.
//
Familiarity with the web and access to a personal computer are assumed, but
no technical background is required.


== Approach

CSE 199 is being taught a bit differently than some other courses that you
might take at college.
//
Rather than a series of lectures with homework outside of class, we're going
to assign lectures (in the form of short videos) _outside_ of class and have
you do interesting activities _inside_ class.
//
This is sometimes know as the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom[flipped classroom] model.
//
So rather than referring to our large meetings as lectures, we're calling
them _activity sections_.
//
You'll have two one-hour activity sections per week plus one one-hour
recitation in a smaller group of around 25 to 30 students.

Because how we are teaching you is a bit different, your responsibilities as
as student are a bit different.
//
Here's how a typical week would work from your perspective:

. *Before class on Monday and Wednesday*: watch the assigned videos online.
//
Monday's activity will depend on knowledge obtained from these videos.
//
We are recording around 60 to 90 minutes of video content per week in the
form of 12 to 18 5 minute videos.
//
So you should expected to watch around 30 to 45 minutes of video content
before each activity section.
//
We consider that to be reasonable, and we will try to keep the videos a lot
more interesting than your average textbook.
//
However, we would advise budgeting at least 60 to 90 minutes before each
class to complete the video assignments--in case you need to watch one more
than once or return to videos to review.
//
. *In class on Monday and Wednesday*: complete an interesting activity in
small groups of around four students.
//
Each activity section has around 6 undergraduate teaching assistants and an
instructor that will be on hand to help out during class.
//
. *In recitation on Thursday or Friday*: discuss the week's material in a
smaller group.
//
Recitations are a great chance to ask questions about the video content and
engage in discussions surrounding the material.

Note that <<grades,your grade>> in this course is largely driven by
participation--watching the videos online and coming to class and completing
the in-class activities.
//
We have a few bits of homework for you to complete outside of class, but
we've mostly moved the homework _inside_ of the classroom.
//
That's one of the advantages of the flipped classroom model.

== Calendar

We suggest that you add our http://goo.gl/5D6g2E[global CSE 199 calendar] to
your calendaring program.
//
If you are not using a calendaring program, we suggest that you begin using a
calendaring program.

Note that the calendar below only has things applicable to all CSE 199
students.
//
These include weekly activities, staff office hours, open shooting sessions,
movie nights, and <<dates,important dates>>.
//
This calendar does _not_ include activity section meeting or recitation
meeting times and locations.

== Information

=== Course Staff

link:https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu[Geoffrey Challen] is providing most of the
content for the class in the form of short videos.
//
But you will notice contributions from others--including other course staff,
other UB CSE faculty members, and hopefully eventually alumni and external
experts footnote:[You will also have a chance to contribute your own videos
as a course assignment.].
//
The four fantastic faculty leading activity sections are
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/index.html[Jesse Hartloff],
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/people/?u=mhertz[Matthew Hertz],
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/people/?u=ahughes6[Andrew Hughes], and
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/people/?u=jwinikus[Jennifer Winikus].

We have a great group of undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants to
help you learn about the internet.
//
https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/people/gjbunyea/[Greg Bunyea] is serving as the
head undergraduate teaching assistant.
//
https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/people/carlnues[Carl Nuessle] is serving as the
head (and only) graduate teaching assistant.
//
The 24 other teaching assistants are Aishani Bhalla, Mohit Bhatia, Isabelle
Caneda, Wesley Csendom, Junjie Chen, Michael Drewitt, David Dobmeier, Lakshmi
Ethiraj, Richard Hanulewicz, Liam Gensel, Harshita Girase, Patrick Jones,
Heeba Kariappe, Valencia Kaplinsky, Lawreen Latif, Angus Lam, Ian Ngumi,
Brijesh Rakholia, Rachel Roberts, Parth Shah, Kyle Schoener, Dan Starner,
Evan Walley, and Grant Wrazen.
//
Phew!
//
That's quite a group.
//
Instructors and teaching assistants are broken down by activity section
<<sections,below>>.

=== Times and Locations

Times and locations for <<sections,activity sections>> and
<<recitations,recitations>> are listed below.
//
You can also find this information on the HUB.

In addition to activity sections and recitations we are planning a number of
other optional--but fun--activities.
//
First, we have several movie nights planned for the semester where we will
watch some great internet-related films footnote:[Clearly Werner Herzog timed
the release of http://www.loandbeholdfilm.com/[Lo and Behold] to coincide
with our class...].
//
Second, we will hold open shooting sessions each week on Wednesday starting
at 10AM.
//
We're still shooting footage for the later weeks in the class, so if you'd
like to be part of the studio audience you are more than welcome--although I
can't spring for any fancy prizes.
//
Details about both of these events will be on the <<calendar,course
calendar>>.
//
The course calendar will also list office hours for all CSE 199 instructors.

=== Exams

We will not give any exams.

=== Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

== Schedule

The course is broken into weekly topic units as described below.
//
Note that topics covered in each week will be discussed at a very high level
and not in anywhere close to as much detail as would be included by more
advanced courses for CSE majors footnote:[Like
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/dimitrio/courses/cse4589_s14/[CSE 489],
taught at least sometimes by the all-knowning--yet
shy&mdash;http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/dimitrio/[Dimitrios
Koutsonikolas].].
//
Using the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol[transmission
control protocol (TCP)] as an example:

* A _detailed technical description_ of
TCP in an advanced CSE course would include description of the various parts
of the TCP header; the handshakes that establish and terminate connections;
acknowledgements, selective acknowledgements, and retransmissions; maximum
segment sizes and IP fragmentation; and dynamics of flow control including
congestion window sizing.
//
* In contrast, in CSE 199 we will explain that the protocol is used to create
a connection between two internet hosts by establishing reliable ordered
delivery of data packets not provided by the internet protocol (IP) alone,
while also explaining that TCP helps share network resources between active
hosts.

Thus higher-level internet design goals and concepts can be discussed without
going into any of the technical details described above footnote:[Which are
also, let's face it, somewhat dull.].
