== Overview

The internet is changing every aspect of our lives, including how we
communicate, learn, navigate, organize, work, play, and love.
//
The internet also represents a crowning achievement of computing: a single
system uniting hardware and software, theory and implementation, standards
and innovation, engineering and science, protests that topple governments and
stupid cat videos.
//
This course provides an overview of how the internet works by describing
everything required to answer a single search query.
//
Along with its technologies, we will delve into the internetâ€™s past and
future, policy challenges, and societal implications.
//
The course is targeted at a general audience, but because the internet
reflects contributions from many areas of computer science and computer
engineering, it also provides a good overview for potential majors.
//
Familiarity with the web and access to a personal computer are assumed, but
no technical background is required.

[[approach]]
== Approach

CSE 199 is being taught a bit differently than some other courses that you
might take at college.
//
Rather than a series of lectures with homework outside of class, we're going
to assign lectures (in the form of short videos) _outside_ of class and have
you do interesting activities _inside_ class.
//
This is sometimes know as the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom[flipped classroom] model.
//
So rather than referring to our large meetings as lectures, we're calling
them _activity sections_.
//
You'll have two one-hour activity sections per week plus one one-hour
recitation in a smaller group of around 25 to 30 students.

Because how we are teaching you is a bit different, your responsibilities as
as student are a bit different.
//
Here's how a typical week would work from your perspective:

. *Before class on Monday and Wednesday*: watch the assigned videos online.
//
Monday's activity will depend on knowledge obtained from these videos.
//
We are recording around 60 to 90 minutes of video content per week in the
form of 12 to 18 5 minute videos.
//
So you should expected to watch around 30 to 45 minutes of video content
before each activity section.
//
We consider that to be reasonable, and we will try to keep the videos a lot
more interesting than your average textbook.
//
However, we would advise budgeting at least 60 to 90 minutes before each
class to complete the video assignments--in case you need to watch one more
than once or return to videos to review.
//
. *In class on Monday and Wednesday*: complete an interesting activity in
small groups of around four students.
//
Each activity section has around 6 undergraduate teaching assistants and an
instructor that will be on hand to help out during class.
//
. *In recitation on Thursday or Friday*: discuss the week's material in a
smaller group.
//
Recitations are a great chance to ask questions about the video content and
engage in discussions surrounding the material.

Note that <<grades,your grade>> in this course is largely driven by
participation--watching the videos online and coming to class and completing
the in-class activities.
//
We have a few bits of homework for you to complete outside of class, but
we've mostly moved the homework _inside_ of the classroom.
//
That's one of the advantages of the flipped classroom model.

[[calendar]]
== Calendar

We suggest that you add our http://goo.gl/5D6g2E[global CSE 199 calendar] to
your calendaring program.
//
If you are not using a calendaring program, we suggest that you begin using a
calendaring program.

Note that the calendar below only has things applicable to all CSE 199
students.
//
These include weekly activities, staff office hours, open shooting sessions,
movie nights, and <<dates,important dates>>.

== Information

=== Course Staff

link:https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu[Geoffrey Challen] is providing most of the
content for the class in the form of short videos.
//
But you will notice contributions from others--including other course staff,
other UB CSE faculty members, and hopefully eventually alumni and external
experts footnote:[You will also have a chance to contribute your own videos
as a course assignment.].
//
The four fantastic faculty leading activity sections are
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~hartloff/index.html[Jesse Hartloff],
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/people/?u=mhertz[Matthew Hertz],
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/people/?u=ahughes6[Andrew Hughes], and
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/people/?u=jwinikus[Jennifer Winikus].

We have a great group of undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants to
help you learn about the internet.
//
https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/people/gjbunyea/[Greg Bunyea] is serving as the
head undergraduate teaching assistant.
//
https://blue.cse.buffalo.edu/people/carlnues[Carl Nuessle] is serving as the
head (and only) graduate teaching assistant.
//
The 24 other teaching assistants are Aishani Bhalla, Mohit Bhatia, Isabelle
Caneda, Wesley Csendom, Junjie Chen, Michael Drewitt, David Dobmeier, Lakshmi
Ethiraj, Richard Hanulewicz, Liam Gensel, Harshita Girase, Patrick Jones,
Heeba Kariappe, Valencia Kaplinsky, Lawreen Latif, Angus Lam, Ian Ngumi,
Brijesh Rakholia, Rachel Roberts, Parth Shah, Kyle Schoener, Dan Starner,
Evan Walley, and Grant Wrazen.
//
Phew!
//
That's quite a group.
//
Instructors and teaching assistants are broken down by activity section
<<sections,below>>.

=== Times and Locations

Times and locations for <<sections,activity sections>> and
<<recitations,recitations>> are listed below.
//
You can also find this information on the HUB.

In addition to activity sections and recitations we are planning a number of
other optional--but fun--activities.
//
First, we have several movie nights planned for the semester where we will
watch some great internet-related films footnote:[Clearly Werner Herzog timed
the release of http://www.loandbeholdfilm.com/[Lo and Behold] to coincide
with our class...].
//
Second, we will hold open shooting sessions each week on Wednesday starting
at 10AM.
//
We're still shooting footage for the later weeks in the class, so if you'd
like to be part of the studio audience you are more than welcome--although I
can't spring for any fancy prizes.
//
Details about both of these events will be on the <<calendar,course
calendar>>.
//
The course calendar will also list office hours for all CSE 199 instructors.

=== Textbook

There is no required textbook for this course.

=== Exams

We will not give any exams.

=== Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites.

== Description

The course is broken into weekly topic units as described below.
//
Note that topics covered in each week will be discussed at a very high level
and not in anywhere close to as much detail as would be included by more
advanced courses for CSE majors footnote:[Like
http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/dimitrio/courses/cse4589_s14/[CSE 489],
taught at least sometimes by the all-knowning--yet
shy&mdash;http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/dimitrio/[Dimitrios
Koutsonikolas].].
//
Using the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol[transmission
control protocol (TCP)] as an example:

* A _detailed technical description_ of
TCP in an advanced CSE course would include description of the various parts
of the TCP header; the handshakes that establish and terminate connections;
acknowledgements, selective acknowledgements, and retransmissions; maximum
segment sizes and IP fragmentation; and dynamics of flow control including
congestion window sizing.
//
* In contrast, in CSE 199 we will explain that the protocol is used to create
a connection between two internet hosts by establishing reliable ordered
delivery of data packets not provided by the internet protocol (IP) alone,
while also explaining that TCP helps share network resources between active
hosts.

Thus higher-level internet design goals and concepts can be discussed without
going into any of the technical details described above footnote:[Which are
also, let's face it, somewhat dull.].

=== Outline

We reserve the right to adjust this schedule as needed.
//
That said, here's what we are trying to accomplish on a week-by-week basis:

== Grading

Grading is largely driven by participation:

* *30% video participation*: watching the online videos.
//
* *30% activity participation*: coming to class and completing activities
with your group.
//
* *30% video contributions*: recording and uploading three short videos (10%
each) with a group drawn from your activity section.
//
* *10% internet participation*: generating or curating online content.

We discuss each of the grading components in more detail below.

=== Video Participation

Watching the videos _before_ coming to class is critical for <<approach,our
approach>> to work.
//
We will monitor and quantify your progress through the video series in a
variety of ways.

=== Activity Participation

Equally important to success in this course is coming to class and
participating in the activities.
//
We will assign you to a new random group for each activity section, and one
group member will be responsible for submitting the group's work and
recording what group members were present.
//
Missing one or two classes during the semester is fine--that happens to
anyone.
//
Missing class repeatedly will make it hard to pass this class.

=== Video Contributions

One of the best ways to learn new material is to explain it to others.
//
We're providing you a way to do that--but to hundreds or thousands of
students in coming years.
//
During the semester you will need to record three short videos for inclusion
in the link:/[`internet-class.org`] video library.
//
Some will be alternative explanations for existing concepts, but in other
cases we will ask you to describe and explain a topic that is related to
the material but not currently covered.
//
More details on these assignments will follow shortly.

=== Internet Participation

As a final assignment we will ask you to participate in the internet.
//
That can take a variety of forms: creating a personal website or blog,
maintaining a https://www.wikipedia.org/[Wikipedia] page, contributing to a
open source software project perhaps on https://www.github.com[GitHub], etc.
//
We are open to many different ideas here, but just to note: normal social
networking activities _will not_ earn you credit for this activity.
//
You'll discuss this assignment in more detail with your activity section
leader and course staff later in the semester.

=== Grade Mapping

=== Incomplete Grades

Please refer to the
http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/grading/explanation.shtml#incomplete[undergraduate]
incomplete policy. Of particular importance is this language:

[quote]
Students may only be given an *I* grade if they have a passing average in
coursework that has been completed and have well-defined parameters to
complete the course requirements that could result in a grade better than the
default grade. _An *I* grade may not be assigned to a student who
  did not attend the course._

=== Academic Integrity

Please review the http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/shared/policies/academic.php[CSE
Department academic integrity policy] and the UB
http://undergrad-catalog.buffalo.edu/policies/course/integrity.shtml[undergraduate]
academic integrity policy to familiarize yourself with the relevant academic
integrity policies and procedures.
//
*Students that submit plagiarized work will receive a grade of F for the
course.*

=== Disabilities

Please register and coordinate with the Office of Disability Services. Let
the course staff know when accommodations need to be made. We are committed
to helping you learn.

=== Online Resources

This website is the source for all information about the class: the syllabus
(which you are reading) and the video series.

=== Mailing List

All enrolled students will be added to a mailing list which we will use for
course communication.
//
*You are responsible for email messages sent to this list, and to your
`@buffalo.edu` email address.*
//
If you are not enrolled and would like to be added to the list, you can sign
up https://www.internet-class.org/mailman/listinfo/199[here].

== Getting Help

Here's how to--and how not to--get help.

=== Great Ways to Get Help

* *Use the the forum.*
//
We will set up an online forum for you to discuss the videos and activities.
//
This is a great resource because it allows you to get help from anyone at any
time--not just during class or recitation.
//
Please use and contribute to this valuable shared resource.

* *Come to office hours.* We don't hold them for our health and
instructors get bored when there isn't anyone to help!
//
So please don't hesitate to come by, even just to say hi.

=== Bad Ways to Get Help

* *Emailing any staff member using their `@buffalo.edu` email address.*
//
I instruct the staff to ignore these emails.
//
Use the forum or talk to them during class.
