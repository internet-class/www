== Overview

The internet is changing every aspect of our lives, including how we
communicate, learn, navigate, organize, work, play, and love.
//
The internet also represents a crowning achievement of computing: a single
system uniting hardware and software, theory and implementation, standards
and innovation, engineering and science, protests that topple governments and
stupid cat videos.
//
This course provides an overview of how the internet works by describing
everything required to answer a single search query.
//
Along with its technologies, we will delve into the internetâ€™s past and
future, policy challenges, and societal implications.
//
The course is targeted at a general audience, but because the internet
reflects contributions from many areas of computer science and computer
engineering, it also provides a good overview for potential majors.
//
Familiarity with the web and access to a personal computer are assumed, but
no technical background is required.
