= Source Directory Layout and Contents

== `content`

The contents of this directory are used to build static site components.
//
The directory is organized by contributor email address.
//
Contributions will be automatically tagged using this email address.
//
So the contents of `content/challen@buffalo.edu/basics/` will be listed as
contributed by challen@buffalo.edu.
//
Directory layout below the email address subdirectory is entirely up to the
contributor.
//
All `contents.adoc` files will be converted into lessons and have unique IDs
generated automatically, if needed.
