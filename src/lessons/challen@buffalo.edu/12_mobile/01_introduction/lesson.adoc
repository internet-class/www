title: "Introduction to the mobile and pervasive internet."
---

Probably the biggest transformation that the internet has had to adapt to is
the rise of mobile devices.
//
Mobility and mobile devices create many challenges to the original internet
architecture, and the evolution of the internet to support mobility is far
from complete.
//
At the same time, the technologies that enabled the mobile internet are also
driving the pervasive internet and the so-called Internet of Things.
//
It seems fairly likely that, sometime soon, the internet will not only be with
us all the time but both everyone and _everything_ will be online.
