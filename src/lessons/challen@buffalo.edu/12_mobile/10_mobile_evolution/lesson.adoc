title: "How is the internet evolving to support mobility?"
---

Many of the modern changes to existing internet protocols are driven by
mobility.
//
Multipath TCP (MPTCP) simplifies the process of roaming across multiple
wireless networks.
//
QUIC and HTTP/2 reduce the number of connections mobile devices need to open
to retrieve a single page.
//
Compression proxies now integrated into mobile browsers reduce the amount of
data transfer needed to communicate with the many web sites that still do not
properly compress HTTP content.
//
And so, in many ways the emerging modern internet and web are really designed
around the needs and characteristics of mobile devices.
