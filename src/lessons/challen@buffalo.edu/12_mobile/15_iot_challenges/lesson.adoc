title: "What are some challenges faced by IoT devices?"
---

Internet of Things (IoT) devices experience many of the same challenges faced
by mobile devices but to an even greater degree.
//
Smartphones are battery powered but can rely on their owners to charge them
regularly.
//
IoT devices may need to last for years on a coin cell battery or harvest
energy from the environment.
//
Smartphones can rely on their owners to troubleshoot network problems.
//
IoT devices must maintain connectivity through changes to the network
environment while also optimizing their communication patterns for extreme
energy efficiency.
//
And smartphones only have to be small enough to fit in a pocket, while IoT
devices are supposed to disappear into the environment around us.
