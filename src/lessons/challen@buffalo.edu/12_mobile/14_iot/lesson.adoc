First came the internet of people--a worldwide computer network connecting
billions of people.
//
Then came the Internet of Things--a worldwide effort to connect billions or
trillions of new things to the existing internet.
//
The Internet of Things will certainly change the way that we live, and makes
it possible to imagine Jetsons-like scenarios.
//
Amazon already lets you put a smart button on your laundry machine so that you
can trigger a shipment of detergent the moment you need it.
//
And at some point soon, milk may show up at your door because your
refrigerator noticed that you were low and decided to order more.
//
But even as these conveniences become less far-fetched, the most interesting
things on the internet will probably continue to be people.
