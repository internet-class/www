title: "What are the ISM bands?"
---

Because they can interfere with each other, wireless communications in the US
are heavily regulated.
//
Only small frequency bands are set aside for general use, referred to as the
industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands.
//
If you have noticed that Wifi devices operate in the 2.4GHz band, or the 5GHz
band, this is why.
//
And as a result of the regulation, a huge amount of highly-important
communications occur only over small slivers of wireless spectrum.
