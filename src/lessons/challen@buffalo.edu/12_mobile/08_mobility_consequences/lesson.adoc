title: "What are some consequences of mobility?"
---

Mobile devices differ from traditional desktop and even laptop computers in
many important ways.
//
They are dependent on wireless connections, smaller and less powerful, and
battery-powered and so energy-limited.
//
More importantly, mobile devices also experience sudden changes in
_conditions_ caused by mobility.
//
Responding to these differences and changes is what makes mobile computing
hard.
