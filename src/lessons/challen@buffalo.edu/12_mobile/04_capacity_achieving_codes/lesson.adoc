title: "What are capacity achieving codes?"
---

You can look at Shannon's capacity theorem as a constraint--or as a challenge.
//
One of the more exciting stories is how improvements to data encoding have
repeatedly increased the data rates achievable by wireless devices.
//
This evolution represents a wonderful fusion of theory and practice.
//
And recently, researchers have begun to be able to formulate so-called
_capacity achieving codes_.
//
These encoding schemes approach the Shannon limit.
//
Unfortunately, they typically require extremely long inputs, making them not
necessarily useful in practice.
