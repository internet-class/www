title: "What is calm computing?"
---

Early in the rise of pervasive computing one of the pioneers of the
field--Mark Weiser--outlined a vision for what he called _calm computing_.
//
In calm computing, pervasive devices fade into the background of our lives.
//
Even with computing surrounding us, and aiding us, we spend less time
interacting with our devices and more time going out our lives.
//
Unfortunately, while Weiser's vision has earned a persistent place in the
mindset of technologists work on pervasive computing, today it remains much
more myth than reality.
//
Our interactions with our devices are frequently anything but calm, and we
spent a growing amount of time fiddling with them to get them to do what we
want.
