Wireless and the mobile internet have really enabled a lot of the widespread
disruption and innovation we've witnessed over the last few decades.
//
Without a smartphone and a mobile data connection you would never be able to
get an Uber, or navigate a city, or browse online reviews for the product in
front of you at the store, or have a video chat with someone from a bar half a
world away.
//
But the internet everywhere has also brought new concerns and challenges for
us, as that disruption extends to our ability to concentrate, engage with
friends, and observe the world around us.
