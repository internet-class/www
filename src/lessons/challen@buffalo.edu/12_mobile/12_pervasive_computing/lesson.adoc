title: "What is pervasive computing?"
---

The combination of wireless technologies and ever-smaller and more powerful
computers has led to the rise of so-called _pervasive_ computing.
//
Pervasive computing describes a world where computers are everywhere and
embedded in most everyday objects.
//
In many ways, we are living through the dawn of this vision.
//
It can be a fun exercise to think about just how many everyday devices already
have computing capability--or will soon.
//
Our buildings, vehicles, and even the external environment have begun to be
filled with computers, and this trend is bound to continue.
