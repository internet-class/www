title: "What is the physical web?"
---

The internet and the world wide web have been driven by and benefited from
open and widely-accepted standards.
//
Every web site servers documents using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing a
single web browser to explore the entire web.
//
Unfortunately, the nascent Internet of Things is not as open or
well-standardized.
//
Vendors sell competing IoT technologies with no cross-device standardization.
//
This leaves consumers with the equivalent of multiple remote controls: one app
to control my home security system, another to control my music player, and so
on.
//
Google's vision of the _physical web_ is trying to encourage IoT devices to
leverage existing web standards.
