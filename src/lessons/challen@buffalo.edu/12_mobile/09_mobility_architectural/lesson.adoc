title: "What internet architecture challenges does mobility cause?"
---

Various parts of the original internet architecture were not well-designed to
support mobility.
//
This was not intention, but simply a reflection of the limited number of
mobile devices that existed at that time.
//
But as mobile devices have grown to become the dominant way that we connect to
the internet, the architecture of the internet has begun to evolve.
//
Connections that used to be tied to unstable identifiers like IP addresses can
now be preserved even as the underlying addresses change.
//
Mobile devices can now make better use of multiple wireless radios and
different ways of connecting to the internet.
//
And higher-layer protocols like HTTP have also begun to respond to the unique
performance characteristics of mobile devices.
