title: "An introduction to old circuit-switched telephone networks."
---

Before there were packets, there were circuits.
//
And before there was automatic dialing, there was a human operator who
_literally_ connected your call.
//
Connected as in moved a wire across their desk from one terminal to another
terminal, establishing a direct link between the two parties on the call.
//
Few things illustrate the differences between packet- and circuit-switched
networks more clearly.
