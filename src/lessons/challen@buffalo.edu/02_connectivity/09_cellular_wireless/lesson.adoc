one--either to a nearby Wifi router or through the cellular data network.

Wireless networking is one of the most exciting developments in the evolution
of the internet.
//
Today, most of us have internet access all the time and almost anywhere.
//
As you probably expect, the infrastructure required to accomplish that is
both impressive and quite interesting.
