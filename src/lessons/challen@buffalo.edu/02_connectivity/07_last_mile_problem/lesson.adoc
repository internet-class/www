title: "What is the last mile problem?"
---

Although the core of the internet is extremely fast, there are bottlenecks at
the edges.
//
This is what is sometimes referred to as the _last mile problem_.
//
Even if the core internet backbone is blazing fast, it doesn't do you any
good if your last mile connection to the internet is slow.
//
And, in many cases, it is--primarily because it wasn't designed to carry
internet traffic.
//
Old voice and TV data lines were designed around the needs of the traffic
that they were hung to carry.
//
At some point we'll get around to running fast fiber optic cable to every
home on earth, but it's not going to happen overnight.
//
There are a lot of last miles to cover, and new infrastructure is expensive.
