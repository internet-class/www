title: "What is a packet?"
---

The internet unites a lot of different computer networks.
//
In many ways, those networks are free to do a lot of things their own way as
long as they agree on a few things.
//
But central the the idea of a modern computer network itself, and to all of
the internet's networks, in the idea of a _packet_.
//
A packet is a single, fixed-size, indivisible unit of information.
//
While Paul Baran and Donald Davies came up with the idea of dividing data
into packets independently, Davies gets credit for the catchy name.
//
(Baran called them message blocks or something equally less catchy.)
