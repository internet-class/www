The physical internet is fun.
//
It's all around us--the wires and tubes and tunnels and cables and antenna
that provide a _physical_ link between billions of computers worldwide.
//
While wireless connections have proliferated at the network edge, the core is
still a wired system composed of computers that are touching each other.
//
The physical internet also draws on and harnesses many previous technologies,
frequently running over cables designed to carry other kinds of signals.
//
Data follows in the footsteps of earlier technologies as it moves between us.
//
So even as the internet defines its own reality--cyberspace--that space still
maps down directly to physical space.
