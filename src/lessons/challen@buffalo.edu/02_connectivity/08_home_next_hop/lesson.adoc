title: "Connected at home: my next hop."
---

As we continue following the cables that bring internet to my home, we
quickly enter the world of shadowy residential internet infrastructure.
//
Like the core internet infrastructure, a lot of these facilities are kept
semi-secret for security purposes.
//
But they aren't that hard to spot.
//
Tell-tale signs include large buildings where nobody seems to work,
windows covered over or bricked in, and cooling infrastructure visible on the
roof (perhaps using Google Maps) to cool the computers inside.
//
Find something like this and you may be looking at bit of your own
neighborhood internet infrastructure.
