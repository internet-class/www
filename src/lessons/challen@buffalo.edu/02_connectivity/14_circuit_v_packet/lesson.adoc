title: "Circuit switching v. packet switching."
---

Circuit switching and packet switching represent two fundamentally different
ways of making use of network resources.
//
In a circuit-switched network a single reliable connection is established and
maintained between communicating parties for the life of their exchange.
//
In contrast, packet-switched networks divide data into packets, each of which
can flow down many different network paths.
