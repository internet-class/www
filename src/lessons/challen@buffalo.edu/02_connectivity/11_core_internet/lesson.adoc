title: "Mapping the core internet."
---

At some point once you get across the wireless connections, past the last
miles and the second-to-last miles, you get into the core internet.
//
The internet's core consists of extremely high-speed high-bandwidth fiber
optic cables that crisscross the country and slip unnoticed beneath the
oceans.
//
A lot of this internet infrastructure is hidden, and for good reason--it's
mission-critical and so somewhat sensitive.
//
But you can still see a bit of it if you know where to look.
