title: "What is the basis for most modern cryptography?"
---

Trapdoor functions have proven fairly difficult to find.
//
Most modern cryptosystems--including RSA--are based on factoring.
//
Given two very large prime numbers it is easy to multiply them together to
create a third number that has only two factors.
//
But given that third number it is very hard to determine what it's two factors
are.
//
This asymmetry is the basis of modern cryptography and most of our online
security.
//
If anyone ever determines how to quickly factor huge numbers, it will have
enormous and incredibly disruptive societal consequences.
