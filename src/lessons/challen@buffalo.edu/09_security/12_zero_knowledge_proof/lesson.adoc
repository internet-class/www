title: "What is a zero-knowledge proof?"
---

One of the more elegant and counterintuitive ideas in modern cryptography is
the notion of a _zero-knowledge proof_ (ZNP).
//
A ZNP allows one party (the prover) to prove to another (the verifier) that
they know a secret *without revealing any information about the secret
itself.*
//
It's a totally wild idea that has deep implications for online security.
