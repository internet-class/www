title: "What is asymmetric encryption?"
---

In symmetric key encryption the same key is used for both encryption and
decryption.
//
In contrast, in assymetric key encryption a public key (known to everyone) is
used for encryption and a private key (known only to the recipient) is used
for decryption.
//
Many asymmetric key encryption approaches are based on factoring as a trapdoor
function, with the public key being the multiple of the two secret primes and
the private key being the two secret primes.
//
Assymmetric key encryption allows one party to encrypt a message to a second
party they have never communicated with previously.
