title: "What is a trapdoor function?"
---

Modern cryptography depends on the existence of several special kinds of
mathematical functions.
//
One important kind is a _trapdoor function_.
//
Trapdoor functions are somewhat similar to hash functions in that they are
easy to compute but hard to invert... except if you know a secret piece of
information.
//
So if someone does not have the secret or key, they cannot invert the
function.
//
If they do, they can open the trapdoor and invert the function.
//
Trapdoor functions form the basis of modern cryptographic techniques that are
widely-used online.
