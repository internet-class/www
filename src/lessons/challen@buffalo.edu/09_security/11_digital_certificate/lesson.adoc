title: "What is a digital certificate?"
---

One use of trapdoor functions is to encrypt a message so that it can be safely
transmitted across an insecure channel.
//
Another use is to allow a sender to _sign_ a message so that the recipient can
verify that the sender originated the message and that the message was not
altered during transmission.
//
Along with encryption, digital signatures form the basis for secure and
trusted communication online.
