title: "What is symmetric encryption?"
---

Crytography has a fascinating history going back thousands of years.
//
However, until relatively recently all crytographic algorithms fell into one
category referred to as _symmetric_ encryption.
//
In symmetric encryption both the sender and receive share a single key that is
used both to encrypt and decrypt messages.
//
Encryption takes a _plaintext_ message and produces a _cyphertext_.
//
Decryption takes the _cyphertext_ message and produces the original
_plaintext_.
//
A variety of simple symmetric encryption algorithms exist.
//
Symmetric encryption is still in wide use today, although computers have
allowe the algorithms that are used to become significantly more complex and
secure.
