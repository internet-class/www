If you want to establish the seriousness of cybersecurity and the importance
of the internet, Stuxnet is a great example.
//
Stuxnet refers to a computer worm that was designed to interfere with uranium
enrichment in Iran.
//
It utilized several zero-day vulnerabilities to cause Iranian centrifuges to
malfunction in what appeared like accidents.
//
Although it has never been confirmed, Stuxnet is believed to be a
highly-sophisticated joint US-Israeli cyberweapon.
//
(To be clear: this discussion is in no way condoning cyberwarfare or any kind
of warfare, or picking a side in this confrontation.)
