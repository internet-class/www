A great example of a software flaw in a deployed cryptosystem is the Heartbleed
vulnerability identified in 2014: also known as CVE-2014-0160.
//
Heartbleed was an extremely serious problem.
//
It exploited a bug in the widespread and popular OpenSSL cryptographic software
library.
//
Attackers could read arbitrary memory contents from the machine that they were
attacking, allowing them to steal keys, passwords, server content, and
anything else that might be stored in the server's memory.
//
Even today we are not yet sure of the amount of information that it exposed.
