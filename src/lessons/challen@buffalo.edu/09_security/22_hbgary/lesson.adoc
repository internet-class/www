title: "What was the HBGary hack?"

  - HBGary

In 2011 the online group Anonymous launched an attack on the company HBGary, a
US security contractor.
//
Within a short period of time they were able to gain access to HBGary's
servers.
//
The company's private emails and private user account data were published and
it's website was defaced.
//
The HBGary hack provides an excellent example of how a motivated group of
hackers can combine social engineering attacks with attacks aimed at software
vulnerabilities--to devastating effect.
//
(Note that this discussion is in no way condoning this or any hack.)
