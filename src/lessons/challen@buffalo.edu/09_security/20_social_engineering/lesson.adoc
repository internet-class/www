title: "What is social engineering?"
---

Many malicious hacks take advantage of flaws in computer systems.
//
But it is a widely-held belief that humans are the weakest link in any
security system.
//
In many cases, hackers gain initial access to the systems that they are
attacking by leveraging so-called _social engineering_ attacks.
//
These attacks are designed to convince humans to provide secure information
that they probably should not.
