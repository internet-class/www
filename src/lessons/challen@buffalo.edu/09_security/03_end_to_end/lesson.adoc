title: "What is end-to-end encryption?"
---

Much of the encryption that is performed online is so-called end-to-end
encryption.
//
End-to-end encryption means encryption and decryption are performed at the
ends of the connection: on the client and server, or on both peers of a
peer-to-peer connection.
//
This is in contrast to link-layer encryption, where encryption is potentially
performed only on one part of a connection--such as a wireless link.
