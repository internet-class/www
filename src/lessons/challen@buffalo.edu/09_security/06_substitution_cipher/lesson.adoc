A simple and easy-to-understand version of symmetric encryption is what is
known as a substitution cipher.
//
The key for a substitution cipher is a table that maps every possible
character in the plaintext message to a different value.
//
To encrypt a message, the sender replaces all characters in the plaintext with
their value in the lookup table.
//
To decrypt a message, the recipient reverses the process.
//
Unfortunately, simple substitution ciphers are extremely insecure and subject
to a variety of simple attacks.
