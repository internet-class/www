title: "What is access control?"
---

Securing the internet also requires making sure that people can access
machines that they should be able to but cannot access them in ways that they
should not be able to.
//
We refer to this as _access control_.
//
For example, I should be able to retrieve web pages from a third-party web
server but not modify them.
//
Or I should be able to send email using a mail server only if I have an
account and only be able to read my email and not email belonging to others.
