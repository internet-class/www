title: "What is hacking?"
---

Hacking is a complicated term.
//
In it's most colloquial form it has become synonymous with programming--hence
the term "hackathon".
//
But it's darker meaning involves breaking into a machine that you don't have
access to--hence the phrase "I got hacked."
//
Malicious hacking take many forms and be done for a variety of reasons.
//
It can exploit flaws with software or, equally often, with the humans that use
and support software systems.
