title: "What is a firewall?"
---

One of the most basic ways to safeguard a computer online is to eliminate the
ability of other computers to connect to it.
//
This can be done entirely or selectively.
//
The software providing this functionality is referred to as a _firewall_.
//
In it's simplest form firewalls simply block incoming connections to various
ports on the protected machine.
//
But they can be much more complex and use a great deal of state and history to
determine whether to allow certain connections.
