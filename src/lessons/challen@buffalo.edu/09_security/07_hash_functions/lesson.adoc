title: "What is a crytographically secure hash function?"
---

Modern cryptography depends on the existence of several special kinds of
mathematical functions.
//
One important kind is a _one-way function_.
//
One-way functions are easy to compute but very hard for anyone to invert.
//
Sometimes we refer to these functions as _hash functions_ and their output as
a hash.
//
Cryptographic hash functions are a subset of hash functions that have special
properties important to their use in cryptography.
