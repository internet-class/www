title: "What is a plaintext? What is a ciphertext?"
---

When discussing encryption we frequently use two terms: _plaintext_ and
_ciphertext_.
//
The plaintext is the original message that the sender wants to securely
deliver to the receiver.
//
The ciphertext is the message that is actually transmitted over the insecure
channel.
//
Before transmission, the sender transforms the plaintext into the
ciphertext--this is _encryption_.
//
When the ciphertext is received, the receiver must transform the ciphertext
back into the plaintext--this is _decryption_.
//
To be secure, encryption and decryption must require that the sender and
receiver possess some secret information or _key_.
//
The goal of most encryption systems is to ensure that the ciphertext cannot be
decrypted--transformed back into the plaintext--without that secret key.
//
This prevents an adversary or anyone able to eavesdrop on the connection from
recovering the original message plaintext.
