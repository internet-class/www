title: "What is a zero-day exploit?"
---

Many malicious hacks take advantage of flaws in computer software.
//
Software is created by humans and, hence, frequently has bugs.
//
If a software developer finds a bug they will try to fix it or notify the
appropriate person or company that the software is flawed.
//
If a malicious hacker finds a bug they will try to exploit it to gain access
to systems or information that they should not have.
//
Until the software vendor finds out about the problem it is known as a
_zero-day exploit_.
