title: "How do two parties exchange keys to communicate securely?"
---

While asymmetric (public-key) encryption does allow two parties to communicate
security without exchanging keys, asymmetric encryption requires expensive
computation for each message.
//
Symmetric key algorithms are much more efficient.
//
As a result, the two techniques are usually applied to establish and maintain
a secure connection.
//
Asymmetric encryption is used to protect the initial part of the connection
where symmetric keys are exchanged.
//
Once communicating parties agree on symmetric keys, symmetric encryption is
used for the remainder of the communication.
