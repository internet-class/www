title: "What is a certificate authority?"
---

Establishing a secure communication channel is important--but how do you know
you are communicating with the right entity?
//
The structure of the internet makes it easy to launch so-called man in the
middle attacks.
//
This allows even secure communication channels to be established with the
wrong site or computer.
//
Alternatively, phishing attacks may try to confuse users by mimicking the look
and feel of websites they are used to--like their bank's site.
//
On the web this problem is solved using so-called _certificate authorities_.
//
A small number of trusted entities provide a basis on which the legitimacy of
other sites can be established.
