title: "Introduction to internet security."

As our lives have moved online we now perform many sensitive or personal
transactions over the internet.
//
When we send email, we want to ensure that it not read or modified during
transmission.
//
When we purchase goods and services, we want to ensure that our payment
information does not fall into the wrong hands.
//
And even when we search the web, we may want to ensure that our explorations
remain private and are not visible to our internet service provider.
//
Accomplishing these tasks requires a complex ecosystem combining beautiful
mathematical algorithms and systems to establish trust and control who can
access what internet resources.
//
Clearly we're still getting it right--few months go by without news of another
hack or security vulnerability.
//
But we're making progress.
