title: "How are host names translated to IP addresses?"
---

Every time you use a host name in a URL, URI, email address, or any other way,
it must be translated to an IP address.
//
The packets exchange by computers on the internet are routed and addressed
_only_ by IP addresses, not at all using the human-readable names created for
our convenience.
