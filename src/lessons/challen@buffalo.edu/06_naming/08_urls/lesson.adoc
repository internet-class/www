title: "What is a URL/URI?"
---

Many (but not all) of the human names that we use on the internet are either
URLs or URIs.
//
URLs are _uniform resource locators_, a subset of the more general _uniform
resource identifier_ (URI).
//
Whether you are using them to identify a web page or a Git repository, URIs
have a common format.
