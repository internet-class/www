title: "What is IPv4 exhaustion?"
---

Unfortunately we are running out of IP version 4 (IPv4) addressses.
//
There are a variety of reasons for this, and a variety of solutions that help
address parts of the problem.
//
But the real solution is a slow migration toward IP version 6 (IPv6) which
provides _a lot_ more addresses.
