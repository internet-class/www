title: "How are domain names hierarchically organized?"
---

Just like IP addresses, domain names are also hierarchically allocated and
organized.
//
In a somewhat-confusing twist, unlike an IP address where the prefix is on the
left and identifies the organization, for a domain name the part that
identifies an organization is on the right--it's the postfix.
//
Nevertheless, once you learn how to parse domain names they make a lot of
sense.
