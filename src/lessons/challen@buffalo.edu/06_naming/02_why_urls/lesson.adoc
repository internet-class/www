title: "Why not just use IP addresses for everything?"
---

Internet-connected computers name each other using IP addresses like
172.217.0.37.
//
One way to avoid naming problems altogether would be to just have humans use
these same names when they use the internet as computers use to identify each
other.
//
Unfortunately, that doesn't work out particularly well.
