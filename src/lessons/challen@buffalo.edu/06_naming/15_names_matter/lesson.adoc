title: "Names matter: domain name pricing, parking, and defensive acquisition."

While the underlying layers use numbers, our experience of the internet is
shaped by domain names.
//
Some (like Google) have even become verbs.
//
As you might expect, a robust market has emerged involving buying and selling
domain names.
//
In some cases, people even take preemptive measures to acquire domain names
that they think might someday be used to make fun of them.
