title: "Why should you learn how to use the command line?"
---

It seems like a relic of days gone by.
//
Why would anyone want to interact with their computer using just a terminal
and a keyboard?
//
Aren't mice great?
//
Don't we all want to point and click?
//
Is the GUI a major step forward?
//
Well, sometimes.
//
But the command line remains a more powerful way to access your computer.
//
Learn it--you won't regret that you did.
