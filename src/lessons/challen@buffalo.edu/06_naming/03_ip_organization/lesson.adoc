title: "How and why are IP addresses hierarchically organized?"
---

IP addresses are organized and allocated hierarchically.
//
This simplifies both IP address administration and the routing tables used by
internet routers.
//
The result is that IP addresses have a variable-length prefix that identifies
the organization that administers them and path that is used when routing
packets.
//
The original internet design set up three address classes, although this
decision has been revisited since then.
