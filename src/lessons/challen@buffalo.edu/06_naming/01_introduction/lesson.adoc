title: "Introduction to internet naming."
---

Naming is an interesting computer science problem, and quite interesting
online.
//
The internet must reconcile the numbers that computers like to use when
talking to each other with the readable and meaningful names that humans like
and remember.
//
Names also need to have structure to aid with routing and establishing trust
online.
//
We tackle this problem in a few ways.
//
One is by translating human-readable names to machine-readable names.
//
Another solution is establishing conventions, the result being that port 80 is
how associated with unencrypted HTTP protocol connections.
//
Administration of online names is also distributed in reasonable ways, giving
organizations control over various parts of both human and machine readable
namespaces.
