title: "What is DHCP?"
---

Because IP addresses are managed and allocated by your internet service
provider (ISP), your computer's IP address will generally change depending on
how you are connected.
//
Frequently for computers that only act as clients IP address are only provided
when a machine connects to the internet.
//
Your computer probably obtains an IP address this way on campus, using a
protocol called the _Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol_ (DHCP).
//
If you use a wireless router at home, it probably hands out private IP
addresses in the same way.
