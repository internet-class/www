title: "What is IPv6?"
---

The ultimate solution to the IPv4 exhaustion problem and other issues with
IPv4 is the next generation of IP: IP version 6, or IPv6.
//
IPv6 widens the 32-bit IPv4 addresses to 128 bits, which creates _a lot_ more
addresses.
//
The larger address space also simplifies various aspects of network
administration.
//
Unfortunately IPv6 is not backwards compatible with IPv4 and so it is taking a
long time to roll it out.
//
But we're getting there.
//
Today you might already notice that one or several of your computers sometimes
has an IPv6 address.
