title: "What is the domain name service (DNS)?"
---

Domain name to IP address translation happens all the time on the internet.
//
The core internet service responsible for translating machine names to numbers
is the domain name service, also known as _DNS_.
//
DNS can be thought of as a distributed phone book in which computers all over
the world regularly exchange information about correct translations.
//
However, DNS is a bit more complicated than a phone book in ways that have
important implications for internet performance.
