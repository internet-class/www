title: "What are well-known TCP port numbers?"
---

Translation is one approach to naming things online.
//
Another is convention.
//
Conventions establish defaults that associate semantics with numbers.
//
A good example of this approach are _well-known TCP port numbers_.
//
When your web browser wants to retrieve a web page over an insecure
(unencrypted) connection, it tries to open a connection to TCP port 80 on the
host.
//
There's no reason that 80 is 80--it's just what we've agreed on.
