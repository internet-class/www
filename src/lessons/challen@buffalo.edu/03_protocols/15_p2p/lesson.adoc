title: "What is a peer to peer system?"
---

The distinction between clients and servers is useful and common in many
internet interactions.
//
But the client-server model creates problems, particularly given the
importance of the servers themselves.
//
If the servers go down, clients cannot obtain service.
//
As a result, other systems are built using what is called a _peer to peer_
model.
//
In a peer-to-peer (P2P) system, all participants act as both clients and
servers, increasing the resiliency of the system.
