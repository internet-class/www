title: "What is the internet protocol stack?"
---

There are many different protocols that run on the internet, given that
protocols power every internet service.
//
By arranging protocols hierarchically, or into a _protocol stack_, this
allows us to separate concerns and ensure that protocols can focus on doing a
specific job well.
//
Higher-level protocols can rely on functionality from lower-layer protocols
and use them as needed to build interesting services.
