title: "Can you still deploy new transport protocols?"
---

The core internet transport protocols including TCP and UDP are fairly baked
in to the design and implementation of the internet.
//
Changing them, or changing IP itself, requires updating billions of
computers.
//
Happily, UDP adds so little on top of IP that building on top of UDP is
almost equivalent to building on top of IP.
//
Innovators are using that ability today to deploy new transport protocols.
