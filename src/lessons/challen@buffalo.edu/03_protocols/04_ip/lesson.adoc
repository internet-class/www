title: "What is the internet protocol?"
---

What unites the different computer networks that make up the internet is an
agreement to communicate using the _internet protocol_.
//
Given that the internet protocol is named after and defines the internet, you
might think that it was somewhat important.
//
And it is.
//
But just as interesting as the internet protocol itself is what the internet
protocol _does not_ do.
