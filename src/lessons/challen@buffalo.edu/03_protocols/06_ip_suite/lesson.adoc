title: "What is an internet protocol (IP) address?"
---

Keeping the internet protocol simple is an important part of the design of
the internet.
//
But the core internet protocol doesn't do quite enough to enable more
complicated protocols to build on top of it.
//
Instead, we talk about the internet protocol _suite_, typically referred to a
TCP/IP.
//
TCP/IP combines the internet protocol (IP) with a pair of transport protocols
that provide reliability and ordered delivery (if needed) as well as extra
naming.
