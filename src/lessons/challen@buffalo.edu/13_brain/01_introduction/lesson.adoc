The earliest computer scientists envisioned computers as a way to supplement
our own limited human intelligence.
//
They did not necessarily realize that a global computer network was required
to realize that dream.

But as computers and the internet have become integral to our lives, it is
important to understand how they both complicate and challenge our human
capabilities.
//
Computers can complement us--or they can control us.
//
The choice is ours.
