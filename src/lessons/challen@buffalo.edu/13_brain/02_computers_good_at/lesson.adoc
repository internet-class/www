title: "What are computers good at that humans are not?"
---

To understand how computers complement us, it's important to compare our
capabilities with theirs.
//
Computers are great at certain things, particularly storing and processing
information.
//
Their memories are far better than ours, as is their ability to perform simple
mathematical operations.
//
Their speed combined with their storage abilities makes them far better than
us at dealing with large amounts of information, and at making split-second
decisions.
