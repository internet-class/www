spelling_exceptions:
  - microinteractions

Another reason that we can become so immersed in computers and the internet is
that computers provide us with a great deal of positive reinforcement.
//
We type, and see our words appear.
//
We click on a link, and a new page appears or a video starts to play.
//
We run a command, and a program is compiled.
//
Unlike the rest of the world, which can be messy and full of surprises,
computers provide a series of positive and satisfying microinteractions.
//
Unfortunately, this can create unrealistic expectations for the rest of our
lives.
