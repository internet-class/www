title: "Should you use a laptop in class?"
---

One of the more important technology-related decisions you'll have to make in
college is whether to bring and use your laptop to class.

Some professors may try to help you make this decision, but most of the time
it will be up to you.
//
Like any decision involving technology, there are pros and cons on both sides,
and a lot depends on you and how you use the technology--not its presence
alone.
