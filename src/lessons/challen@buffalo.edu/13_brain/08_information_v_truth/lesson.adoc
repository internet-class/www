title: "Given all the information online, why are we still confused?"
---

One of the early hopes about the internet is that access to large amounts of
information would help us make better decisions.
//
And yet, even with more data at our fingertips than ever before, we continue
to be confused.
//
We even hold beliefs that are at odds with widely-available information.
//
Unfortunately, additional information has been accompanied with additional
misinformation.
//
And, it turns out that it is harder to change our minds than we think.
