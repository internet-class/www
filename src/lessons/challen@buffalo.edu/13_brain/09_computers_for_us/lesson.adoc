title: "What are computers and the internet doing for us?"
---

The story of human-computer co-evolution is not all doom and gloom.
//
Computers are helping us and enriching our lives in many ways.
//
Could we explore an unfamiliar city in the same way without the certainty that
our smartphone will help us find our way home?
//
Could we maintain relationships with far away friends without email and video
chat?
//
Would we remember as much about our lives without our online photo albums and
Facebook feeds?
//
And would we ever have the chance to meet and interact with so many different
people with different customs and beliefs as we have online?
//
Clearly, computers and the internet are doing a lot for us.
