title: "Why are computers so distracting?"
---

Computers can be highly distracting.
//
The reasons are related to the design of our two different human attention
systems.
//
Humans are hard-wired to both be able to immerse ourselves, and to be able to
respond quickly to surprises.
//
Computers--and particularly our mobile devices--provide us with both kinds of
stimuli.
//
And this combination can cause us to lose focus of other things that we should
be doing, whether it is driving a vehicle or listening to a good friend.
