title: "What are computers doing to us?"
---

As computers enrich our lives, there is growing evidence that they are also
altering the way that we behave--sometimes in negative ways.
//
Our attention span may be dropping as we become more easily distracted.
//
Our ability to store and synthesize data may be decreasing as we rely more on
the internet to remember things.
//
Online, algorithms and our own choices may be dividing us into mutually
suspicious camps separately by beliefs supported by questionable or
selectively-interpreted evidence.
//
Part of our success in taking control over our computer creations is
understanding and resisting these transformations.
