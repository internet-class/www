title: "What is a router?"
---

Computers on the internet can be divided into two categories--routers, and
_end-hosts_.
//
End-hosts are most of the computers you are familiar with.
//
Routers, on the other hand, operate within the core of the internet.
//
While end-hosts run higher-level protocols, routers typically only run the
internet protocol.
//
And while end-hosts would be familiar to you, routers are _highly-specialized_
pieces of dedicated hardware.
//
Their job is to one job and do it really well--make choices for how to direct
packets onward toward their destination.
