title: "What is a man-in-the-middle attack?"
---

Because connections on the internet span many different machines, compromising
a machine on a routing path can allow the attacker to observe a lot of
traffic.
//
This is also known as a _man-(or woman)-in-the-middle attack_.
//
Even if packet contents are encrypted, observing communication patterns
between computers can expose things that the communicating parties may want to
reveal.
