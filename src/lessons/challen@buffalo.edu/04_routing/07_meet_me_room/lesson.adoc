title: "What is a meet-me room?"
---

Many autonomous systems peer only with one or several large autonomous systems
run by large internet service providers (ISPs).
//
This ensures that they can reach all other ASes that are connected to the
internet, but doesn't always provide optimal routes--particularly for
geographically proximate ASes.
//
For example, two autonomous systems located in the same town might find that
their traffic actually requires many additional hops if sent through a large
ISP.
//
It would be much more efficient for them to establish a direct connection with
each other.
//
Meet-me rooms or internet exchange points (IXPs) are places designed to enable
these connections.
//
Any interested AS in the Buffalo area, for example, could run a cable from
their network to a meet-me room allowing them to connect (or peer) with many
other local ASes.
