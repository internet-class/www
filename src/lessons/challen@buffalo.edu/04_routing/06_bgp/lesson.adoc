title: "What is the border gateway protocol (BGP)?"
---

Routing on the internet is actually performed between autonomous systems
(ASes).
//
Those autonomous systems need a way to determine how to send data to ASes that
they are not directly connected with.
//
To do this, the use the border gateway protocol, or BGP.
//
By exchanging routing announcements using BGP routers located in each
autonomous system can eventually build up a routing table allowing them to
determine the best way to reach any other AS connected to the internet.
