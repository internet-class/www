title: "What is an autonomous system?"
---

The internet is an internetwork--a network of computer networks.
//
When discussing routing, we sometimes refer to these independent networks as
_autonomous systems_.
//
Each autonomous system is responsible for routing packets internally.
//
To travel across the broader internet, packets must traverse multiple
autonomous systems.
//
So it is more accurate to think of internet routing as happening across
autonomous systems, rather than between individual computers.
//
So yes: the internet is an internetwork--a network of computer networks!
