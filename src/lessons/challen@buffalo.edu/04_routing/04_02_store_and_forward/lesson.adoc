title: "What is store and forward routing?"
---

Internet routers operate using a technique called store and forward.
//
Packets that arrive from any link are put into a memory buffer.
//
A separate process grabs packets out of the buffer and tries to route them on
to their destination.
//
Buffering packets in memory allows the router to deal with fluctuations in
load and with differences in capacity between its links.
