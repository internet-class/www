Any computer network faces a tradeoff.
//
Adding more links creates more capacity and makes the network more robust,
since packets can be routed around link failures.
//
However, links are infrastructure and therefore expensive.
//
The internet strikes a balance between the extremes of a fully-connected (and
absurdly expensive) network and a minimally-connected (but fragile) network.
