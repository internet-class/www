title: "Introduction to internet routing."
---

For billions of computers to be able to communicate with each other, the
internet has to be able to _route_ packets between them.
//
Routing is a core internet function and the only thing that makes
long-distance computer-to-computer communication possible.
//
Routing also presents an interesting set of challenges.
//
Routing decisions have be made extremely quickly, which places constraints on
the structure of the IP addresses used during the routing process.
//
Routers have be able to determine how to route packets appropriately, which
requires separate protocols.
//
Ideally routes are stable (don't change over time) but also robust (change if
existing paths become overloaded or unusable).
//
So there's a lot of interesting stuff to discuss here.
