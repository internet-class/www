title: "What is an end-host?"
---

Computers on the internet can be divided into two categories--routers, and
_end-hosts_.
//
End-hosts are most of the computers you are familiar with.
//
The comprise the start and end points of most connections on the internet.
//
Your laptop is an end host.
//
So is your smartphone, and your desktop (if you have one), and the web servers
or other servers that you connect to.
