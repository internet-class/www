title: "What was the Morris worm?"
---

A fun bit of early internet history concerns a famous computer worm launched
by Robert Morris in 1988.
//
While the intent of the worm was to map the internet, its effect was that the
_entire_ early internet had to be taken offline and repaired--something that
would be impossible or at least incredibly inconvenient today.
//
Robert Morris was convicted of a computer crime...  but is also now a tenured
professor of computer science at MIT.
