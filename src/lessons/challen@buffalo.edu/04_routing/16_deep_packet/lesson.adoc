title: "What is deep packet inspection?"
---

Typically routers are designed to only look at the destination address of each
packet.
//
This allows routing decisions to be made as quickly as possible.
//
However, routers _do_ have access to the rest of contents of the packets that
pass through them.
//
Looking at other parts of the packet it referred to as _deep packet
inspection_.
//
Deep packet inspection can be used to accomplish many things, but it's not
clear whether any of them are good things to do.
