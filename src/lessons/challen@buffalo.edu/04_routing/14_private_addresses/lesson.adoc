title: "What are private IP addresses?"
---

Several blocks of internet protocol (IP) addresses are marked as unroutable
and also called private IP addresses.

Core internet routers encountering a packet with an unroutable address will
drop it immediately.
//
So what are unroutable addresses for?
//
Despite seeming useless, they play an important role in today's internet
routing architecture.
