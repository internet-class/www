title: "How are IP addresses structured to enable efficient routing?"
---

Routing is a critical core internet function.
//
It has to be fast.
//
Really fast.
//
If all IP address required their own routes that each router would have to
store, routing tables would have around 4 billion entries.
//
Routers use special hardware to improve routing performance and those hardware
components cannot hold anywhere close to 4 billion entries.
//
Instead, to reduce the number of routing table entries we organize IP address
hierarchically.
//
This allows routers to make routing decisions by only examining some part of
the _prefix_ of the IP address, rather than the entire address.
