title: "What is the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)?"
---

The core internet protocol suite (IP, TCP, and UDP) is primarily concerned
with moving data between computers on the internet.
//
But it also includes another protocol that is entirely dedicated to control
traffic: the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP).
//
Despite the fact that ICMP is not concerned with carrying data, it does enable
several tools that we can use to find out more about the internet's structure.
