title: "What are some problems with internet routing?"
---

Internet routing works most of the time, but problems can arise.
//
Two examples are _routing loops_ and _route flapping_.
//
Routing loops can cause packets to circle in the network without ever reaching
their destination.
//
Route flapping can cause routers to change their minds frequently and lead to
a lot of unnecessary routing announcements.
