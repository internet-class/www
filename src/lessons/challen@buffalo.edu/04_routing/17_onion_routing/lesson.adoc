title: "What is onion routing?"
---

Routing is a fundamentally public activity.
//
Core internet routers can see both where the packet is going and where it came
from.
//
Even if the contents are encrypted, in certain cases it is dangerous to even
expose that two computers on the internet are communicating with each other.
//
One solution is known as _onion routing_.
//
In onion routing, the structure of the messages combined with clever
encryption allow routers to only know the previous and next hops--but not the
source or the final destination.
