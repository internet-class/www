title: "What is a Flash plugin?"
---

Adobe Flash was another early technology used to create interactive web
experiences.
//
In particularly, Flash was used to stream video from sites like YouTube for
many years.
//
Unfortunately, Flash, like Java applets, seems on its way out.
//
Again, the reasons are complicated.
//
For video, the HTML standard caught up to Flash and now supports video files
natively, eliminating the need for Flash plugins on many sites that use video.
//
A public feud with Apple probably did not help either, along with Adobe's
brief attempt to monetize use of the platform by forcing developers to
purchase licenses to use certain features.
//
Adobe themselves announced in 2011 that they would discontinue development of
Flash for mobile devices and focus on HTML5.
