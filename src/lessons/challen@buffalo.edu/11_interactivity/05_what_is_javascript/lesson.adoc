title: "What is JavaScript?"
---

JavaScript is a dynamic, untyped, interpreted programming language.
//
It was designed by Brendan Eich and first appeared in early versions of
Netscape Navigator in September 1995.
//
Critically--when compared with Java, Flash, and other interactive web
technologies--JavaScript has long been supported by all major web browsers
_without_ plugins.
//
Recently, there has also been a surge of interest in server-side scripting
using JavaScript using implementations such as `node.js`.
//
This allows for a more seamless web development experience since the same
programming language runs both on the client and on the server.
