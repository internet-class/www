title: "What was a Java applet?"
---

Java applets represent an early--and failed--attempt to bring interactive
experiences to the web.
//
Today Chrome has dropped support for applets altogether.
//
Why the interactive web moved away from applets and toward JavaScript is a
subject of debate.
//
The fact that applets require software that must be installed outside the
browser and special browser plugins to work may be part of the reason.
