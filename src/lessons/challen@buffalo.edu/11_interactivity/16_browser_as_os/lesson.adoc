title: "Has the browser become the modern OS?"
---

For decades native applications ran on top of a resource manager called an
_operating system_.
//
Now, multiple web applications run in separate tabs inside an application
called the web browser.
//
This shift has caused web browsers to be faced with many of the same problems
faced by traditional operating systems.
//
It has also proved extremely disruptive to large companies that built
businesses around selling operating systems and native software.
