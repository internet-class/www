title: "What is jQuery?"
---

As JavaScript has taken off, a number of useful libraries have appeared that
make developing JavaScript applications or even small pieces of JavaScript
easier.
//
One of the more important is jQuery.
//
jQuery provides programming access to the DOM in a clean, cross-browser
fashion.
//
It also has come to include code to perform many common web application tasks,
such as registering event handlers and performing web requests.
