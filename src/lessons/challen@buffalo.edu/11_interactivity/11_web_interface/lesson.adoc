The changes in design patterns that have led to the rise of web apps have been
accompanied by changes to the way that web servers are used.
//
Today, many client-side JavaScript web applications and standalone
applications make use of _web interfaces_.
//
A web interface allows a site to expose functionality to both web apps and
other applications.
//
For example creating a user on a particular site or granting them access to
some resource would be done via a HTTP POST to a particular URL.
//
The contents of that message would describe what should be done, and the web
interface would respond with a message in JSON, XML, or HTML describing the
result of the action.
//
When the HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) are used properly and no state is
carried between actions, the interface is sometimes referred to a RESTful
(representational state transfer).
