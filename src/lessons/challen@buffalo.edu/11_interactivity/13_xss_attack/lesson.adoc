title: "What is a cross-site scripting attack?"
---

The explosion of JavaScript has created many security problems.
//
One of the more important are so-called cross-site scripting attacks.
//
These attacks attempt to violate the _same origin_ policy normally used to
protect content on web pages that may come from multiple sources.
//
For example, JavaScript that is loaded by an HTML iFrame cannot normally
access page contents outside of the iFrame, which could include sensitive
information.
//
However, in some cases badly designed web applications will allow users to
accidentally run JavaScript in the context of the page--frequently as the
result of clicking on a link provided by the attacker.
//
In other cases, social engineering is used to convince users to cut and paste
a dangerous piece of JavaScript into their browser--for example, to view the
fictional Osama bin Laden death video.
