title: "How does JavaScript enable web apps?"
---

JavaScript is the core technology that enables today's web applications.
//
At a high level, many user interactions are characterized by some input that
needs to be handled, which triggers some operation, and then updates the
interface to reflect that the action took place.
//
JavaScript is all phases of this design pattern.
//
It can be trigger to run on many different types of input events.
//
It can perform all kinds of computation and communicate with web servers.
//
And it can update the display by modifying the Document Object Model initially
constructed from the page's HTML.
