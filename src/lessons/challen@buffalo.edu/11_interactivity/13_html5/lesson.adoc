title: "What is HTML5?"
---

As the web has evolved, HTML has evolved along with it.
//
The newest HTML standard--HTML5--was published in October 2014 by the World
Wide Web Consortium.
//
It provides a number of new features designed to reflect the modern
interactive web experience, including native support for audio and video
elements and scriptable 2D graphics rendering.
//
It also standardizes page interfaces and the document object model (DOM) used
by JavaScript.
//
Many observers noted that HTML5 began to subsume some of the core
functionality previously provided by Flash, leading to decreased use of Flash
plugins.
