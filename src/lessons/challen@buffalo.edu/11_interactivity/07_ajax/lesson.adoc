title: "What is AJAX?"
---

One of the core capabilities that enable web application is the ability of
JavaScript to perform network operations in the background.
//
The original name for this design pattern was AJAX: asynchronous JavaScript
and XML.
//
However, today the wire format for data exchange between client-side
JavaScript and the backend server is as likely to be JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) or something else, rather than XML.
//
But the concept remains: JavaScript can both send and receive data from a web
server in the background, either with or without user interaction.
//
These requests do not trigger the page to reload in the traditional sense, and
they are happening all the time for web apps without you noticing.
