How the web morphed from a content delivery platform to an app delivery
platform is probably one of the more fascinating stories in technology.
//
The original internet served static webpages.
//
Then servers began generating those pages dynamically.
//
Then client-side code started to become a large part of the web experience.
//
And now, many web applications consist almost entirely of client-side code
that makes little to no use of earlier web paradigms.
//
This transition has brought fundamental and deep changes to the modern
computing experience.
