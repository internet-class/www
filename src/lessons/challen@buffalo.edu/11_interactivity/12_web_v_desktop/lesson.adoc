title: "Why are web apps taking over?"
---

Native apps have many advantages over web applications that run in the
browser.
//
These include better performance and better access to system resources and
capabilities.
//
However, today many apps that used to run natively are now run in the browser.
//
These include email, word processing, music and video streaming, photo editing
and sharing, and even some games.
//
There are many reasons for this shift, including advantages provided by web
applications and the poor design of desktop applications.
//
But today, on many computers the only application you need is a web browser.
//
Once you have one, you can do everything else.
