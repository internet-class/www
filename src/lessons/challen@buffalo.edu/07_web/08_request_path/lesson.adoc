title: "How is the path used by a web request?"
---

The web has continued to evolve since it was originally created.
//
A great example of that evolution is how the path in a HTTP request is
inteprereted by the web server.
//
In the early days of the web, that path frequently named an actual HTML
document that was stored on the server--it was a file name.
//
But as the web evolved and server side page rendering became more common the
semantics of the path changed.
//
Now it can mean pretty much anything that the server wants it to.
//
And it's probably most accurate to think of it as providing parameters to a
_function call_ on the server that returns a web document.
