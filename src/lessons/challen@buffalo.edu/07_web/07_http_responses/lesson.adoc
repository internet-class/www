title: "What are common HTTP protocol responses?"
---

HTTP requests define how a client can make requests to a server.
//
But the protocol also must define how the server can respond.
//
In many cases the response includes a document of some kind, maybe the one
that was requested.
//
But the HTTP protocol also defines many _response codes_ that the server can
use to indicate various types of things to the client.
//
That's why 404 has become associated with not being able to find something...
