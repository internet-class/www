title: "Why separate content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)?"
---

With the introduction of cascading style sheets (CSS), web pages separated the
content and semantics contained in the HTML from presentation logic contained
in the CSS.
//
This separation is both useful and very powerful.
//
It helps create compact HTML and helps sites create a consistent look across
multiple web pages.
