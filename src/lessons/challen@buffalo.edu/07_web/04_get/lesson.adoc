title: "How is the GET HTTP protocol request used?"
---

`GET` is by far the most common request used by HTTP, one of the most common
application-level internet protocols.
//
So if you understand `GET` you are a long way towards understanding a lot of
what happens online.
//
`GET` requests a document from a web server.
//
It can also pass some parameters that the server can use when determining how
to return the document.
