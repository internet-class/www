The world wide web has come to define our experience of the internet.
//
The web browser has not only become the one must-have piece of software on any
machine, but web applications that run inside the browser have begun to
replace traditional desktop applications.
//
As defined by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the web consists of three components: names
(URLs), a protocol (HTTP), and a specific type of markup (HTML).
//
These innovations have proven remarkably durable.
//
Web names have broadened to cover many non-WWW uses, the HTTP protocol is now
used by smartphone apps as well as web browsers, and HTML has evolved to help
create ever richer online experiences.
