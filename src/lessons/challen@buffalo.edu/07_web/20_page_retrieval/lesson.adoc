title: "How are pages retrieved by a web browser?"
---

Retrieving a web page typically requires multiple `GET` requests.
//
The first retrieves the initial HTML document.
//
Subsequent requests then retrieve all the other parts of the page:
stylesheets, images, JavaScript code, and other page components.
//
The process is complex and its performance depends to a great deal on the
resources that are involved.
