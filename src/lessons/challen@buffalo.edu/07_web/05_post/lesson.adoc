title: "How is the POST HTTP protocol request used?"
---

Probably the second most common HTTP protocol request is `POST`.
//
Unlike `GET`, `POST` is not used to request documents--instead, it is used by
clients to send data to the server.
//
If you have logged on to a website, purchased anything online, or sent an
email through a web mail client, then you've submitted a `POST` request.
