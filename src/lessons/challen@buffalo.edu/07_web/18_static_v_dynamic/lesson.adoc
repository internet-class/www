title: "What is the difference between a static and dynamic web page?"
---

On the early web paths corresponded to files located on the web server.
//
The server retrieved the file and delivered its contents to the client.
//
But on today's web, the path is frequently used to _dynamically_ create a page
that is then sent back to the client.
//
The easiest way to see this process in action is to do one of the more common
things people do online: launch a web search.
//
Clearly the server doesn't have pages sitting around waiting for every
possible search!
