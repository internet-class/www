title: "What server-side rendering?"
---

On the dynamic web requests paths are dynamically converted to HTML documents.
//
There are many, many ways to do this--new ways, old ways, good ways, and
not-so-good ways.
//
We'll look at an example that highlights some of the common features of many
modern dynamic server-side rendering frameworks.
//
First, the request path is mapped to a function.
//
Second, that function performs some computation, possibly using information
provided by the client as input.
//
Finally, the results are fed to a templating system that uses them to
construct the page using a mixture of static and dynamic content.
