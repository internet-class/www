title: "What is the document object model (DOM)?"
---

JavaScript interacts with the page contents through an abstraction known as
the _document object model_ or, more typically, the DOM.
//
The DOM consists of the HTML converted into a tree-based representation of the
page's contents.
//
The browser builds the initial DOM based on the page's HTML source, but from
that point on the DOM can evolve as determined by the JavaScript.
