title: "What is hypertext markup language (HTML)?"
---

Hypertext markup language is the markup language that defines the web.
//
It defines how elements of page are structured and their relationships to each
other.
//
Unlike cascading style sheets (CSS), which should describe how page elements
_look_, correct HTML defines the _semantics_ of page content.
//
For example, HTML might define that a certain block of text is a single
paragraph.
//
CSS might then define how much space there should be between that paragraph
and the paragraphs before and after it.
