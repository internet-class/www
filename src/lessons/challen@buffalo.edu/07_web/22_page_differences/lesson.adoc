title: "Why do pages sometimes look different on different web browsers?"
---

Despite the HTML being identical, different web browsers sometimes render the
same page differently.
//
This drives web developers nuts.
//
There is no good technological reason for it, but there is a good human
reason--different web browser developers interpreted the same standards
differently.
//
Happily we're making a bit of progress on this problem recently.
