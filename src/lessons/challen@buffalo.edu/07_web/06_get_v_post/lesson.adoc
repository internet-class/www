title: "What is the difference between GET and POST?"
---

Both `GET` and `POST` HTTP requests can send data to the web server.
//
`GET` encodes data into the URL, while `POST` includes it in the body of the
message.
//
But there are important semantic differences between `GET` and `POST` requests
which explain why `POST` is almost always (and should be) used for form
submissions that change the state of the world.
