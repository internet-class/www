title: "What is JavaScript?"
---

JavaScript is probably the most fascinating part of the modern web.
//
Almost every page that you load in your browser comes with a bit of computer
code that runs when the page loads.
//
That computer code can do pretty much anything with the page: change
elements, respond to user input, send web requests in the background, and so
on.
//
Most of our modern experience of the web is defined by JavaScript.
//
To see how pervasive JavaScript is, try disabling it and see if you can get
anything done online!
