title: "What are cascading style sheets (CSS)?"
---

Cascading style sheets (CSS) are a later web innovation allowing the
separation of content semantics and presentation.
//
Unlike HTML, which defines page semantics, CSS is supposed to determine
exactly how page elements should look.
//
Examples include how much white space surrounds elements, the font and font
size that should be used for text, whether images should have borders and what
they should look like, and so on.
