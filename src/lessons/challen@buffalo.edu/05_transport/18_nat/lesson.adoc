title: "How does network address translation work?"
---

TCP port numbers play an important role in a common approach to network
translation.
//
Network address translation allows computers with private IP addresses that
would normally not be accessible to access the internet.
//
A computer that does have a public IP address rewrites the IP address and TCP
port numbers of packets as they are transferred between the server and the
client.
//
NAT plays an important role in addressing one of the design limitations of the
IP protocol: the limited (and exhausted) number of available IP addresses.
