title: "What is latency? What affects latency?"
---

Latency measures how long it takes one packet to travel from one computer on
the internet to another.
//
At least for now, the speed of light places a fundamental bound on how quickly
everything--including information--can move from one place to another.
//
It takes light around 100 ms to circle the globe, so a packet can't arrive any
faster than that!
//
However, most delays on the internet are caused by computers, not by cables.
