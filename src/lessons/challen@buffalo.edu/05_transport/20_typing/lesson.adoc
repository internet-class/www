title: "You need to learn to type."
---

Time for a tool tip: if you can't touch type, start learning now.
//
And if you can't type fluidly and accurately, keep practicing.
//
At some point soon pretty much everything you want to do in life will be at
least somewhat affected by how fast you can type.
//
(Like I'm typing this now, for example.)
