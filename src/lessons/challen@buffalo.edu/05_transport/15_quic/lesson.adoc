title: "What is QUIC?"
---

Among the many problems with TCP is that the approach to reliably delivering
data between machines is one-size-fits-all.
//
But not every connection has the same needs, and some have extra information
that can be used to improve reliable transport.
//
Partly to enable innovation and customization at the transport layer (and
partly to address well-understood problems with TPC), Google has created and
is rolling out QUIC: Quick UDP Internet Connection.
//
QUIC enables secure connections to be established using fewer round-trips,
reducing connection latency--particularly when reconnecting to servers that
have been used before.
//
QUIC is also designed to fetch all of the multiple resources typically needed
to render a web page using a single connection while avoiding the
head-of-the-line that TCP would cause.
