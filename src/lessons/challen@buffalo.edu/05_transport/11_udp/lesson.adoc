title: "What is the universal datagram protocol (UDP)?"
---

The transmission control protocol (TCP) creates reliable and fair connections
between multiple computers on the internet.
//
It is the most widely-used internet transport protocol--at least for now.
//
But there is another widely-deployed transport protocol called the universal
datagram protocol, or UDP.
//
Unlike TCP, UDP provides no reliability.
//
And unlike TCP, UDP provides no flow control or fairness.
//
It does preserve port numbers similar to TCP, although UDP does not establish
a connection between multiple computers.
//
While UDP may seem to jettison several useful features of TCP, the fact that
it exists and many internet-connected computers support it is enabling
important innovation at the transport layer.
