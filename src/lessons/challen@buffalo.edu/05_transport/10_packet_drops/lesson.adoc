title: "Why are packets dropped on the internet?"
---

The transmission control protocol (TCP) is designed to repair packets dropped
by the unreliable internet protocol (IP) layer.
//
But why are packets dropped in the first place?
//
On the wired internet the answer was usually congestion.
//
But the wireless internet is making the answer to this question much more
interesting.
