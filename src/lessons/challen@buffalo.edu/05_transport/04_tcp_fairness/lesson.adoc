title: "How does TCP allow multiple clients to share internet resources?"
---

The transmission control protocol (TCP) allows multiple computers or
connections to share internet resources fairly.
//
It does this by slowing down dramatically when it detects packet loss within
the network.
//
Since packet loss is frequently caused by congestion at some shared link or
router that is servicing multiple TCP connections, one connection slowing down
creates capacity that other connections can use.
//
TCP tries to run connections as fast as possible _without_ losing packets,
which both enables sharing and avoids expensive retransmissions.
