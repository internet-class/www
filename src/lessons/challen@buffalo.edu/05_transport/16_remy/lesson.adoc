title: "What is Remy?"
---

Work on new transport protocols is going on in academic research labs as well
as at large companies.
//
A particularly interesting and innovative approach was recently developed at
MIT and is known as Remy.
//
Remy's developers noted that TCP had been subject to many different tweaks
over the years to its various parameters and behaviors.
//
This led to an exploding space of TCP variants, such as TCP Cubic, TCP New
Reno, etc.
//
Overall, this approach attempts to get TCP to perform better by tweaking it
and hoping that the changes work well when deployed on billions of devices.
//
But TCP has extremely complex interactions with the rest of the network _and_
must work well in large number of different networking environments.
//
In contrast, Remy takes a different approach.
//
Connections place weights on how important bandwidth and latency are to them
and Remy takes care of the rest.
//
It creates computer-generated algorithms that respond to properties of the
connection to outperform even sophisticated approaches designed by humans.
