title: "What is the transmission control protocol (TCP)?"
---

The transmission control protocol (TCP) is today's most widely-used transport
protocol.
//
It adds three pieces of important functionality to the best-effort internet
protocol (IP).
//
First, TCP enables _reliable_ delivery between two internet-connected
computers.
//
Second, TCP allows multiple clients and connections to share network resources
with some degree of _fairness_.
//
Third, TCP adds a layer of naming that separates multiple connections between
the same computers into logical _connections_.
//
The details of how TCP accomplishes these tasks are complex, but the design
principles are fairly simple.
