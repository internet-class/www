title: "What are some problems with TCP?"
---

TCP is an old, very well tested, and venerable protocol.
//
It has enabled reliable internet connections for decades.
//
And yet, it has well-known problems that are causing researchers and engineers
to develop new transport-layer protocols.
//
Some of these problems are being exacerbated by changes to the internet's
architecture, including the growing number of slow and high-latency wireless
connections generated by mobile devices.
