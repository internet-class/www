title: "What is multipath TCP?"
---

TCP is designed to manage a single network connection.
//
But today's mobile devices frequently have multiple ways to connect to the
internet: for example, both a Wifi connection and a mobile data network.
//
TCP was not designed to _switch between_ these connections seamlessly as
required by mobility.
//
And it also cannot take advantage of the increased bandwidth that can be
sometimes achieved by using both connections _simultaneously_.
//
Multipath TCP is a new approach to TCP designed to address these problems.
