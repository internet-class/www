title: "How does TCP enable reliable delivery?"
---

The transmission control protocol (TCP) enables _reliable_ packet delivery
multiple multiple computers connected to the internet.
//
It does this by having the communicating computers exchange information about
what packets have arrived and what have not.
//
By doing this, packets that may have been dropped by the unreliable internet
protocol (IP) layer can be retransmitted and reliable communication achieved.
