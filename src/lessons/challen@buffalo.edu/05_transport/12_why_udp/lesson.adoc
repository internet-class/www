title: "Why would you choose the unreliable UDP protocol over TCP?"
---

Compared to TCP, UDP seems less useful.
//
It drops packets and provides no guidance on how fast packets should be sent.
//
But there are some very important internet applications that can benefit from
unreliable packet delivery and sometimes suffer due to TCP's guarantees.
//
Typical to the design of the rest of the internet, the overall goal is
flexibility.
//
UDP allows applications that do not need TCP's guarantees to avoid them.
