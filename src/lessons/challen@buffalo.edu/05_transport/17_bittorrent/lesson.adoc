title: "What is BitTorrent?"
---

BitTorrent solves a different transport problem that TCP.
//
TCP is designed to allow a pair of machines to exchange data quickly and
reliably.
//
In contrast, BitTorrent is designed for a _large group_ of machines to
exchange the same file quickly and reliably.
//
Rather than optimizing a single path, BitTorrent tries to take advantage of
all available network bandwidth by dividing the transfers needed to retrieve a
single large file between multiple cooperating peers.
//
This allows it to frequently outperform the typical model in which clients
download only from a central server.
