title: "Introduction to the transport layer."
---

The Internet Protocol provides best-effort packet delivery across routes
established within the interior of the internet.
//
Everything else is left to the endpoints--a decision known as the _end to end
principle_.
//
One of the most important tasks _not_ handled by the Internet Protocol is
enabling reliable, efficient, and fair delivery of content from one
internet-connected computer to another.
//
This layer is known as the transport layer and the protocols running at it are
referred to as transport protocols.

In an interesting development, the transport layer reintroduces the idea of a
connection that we discarded at the IP layer in favor of packet-based
communication.
//
Building connections on top of packets preserves many of the benefits of both
approaches.
//
Connections help organize the exchange of information, while packets can still
independently find the best path between hosts and ensure that network
resources are well utilized.
