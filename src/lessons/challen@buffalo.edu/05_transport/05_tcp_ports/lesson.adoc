title: "What is a TCP port and how is it used during connections?"
---

The transmission control protocol (TCP) provides an additional level of naming
that helps organize data transfer between computers connected to the internet.
//
In addition to the internet protocol (IP) address that identifies a computer,
TCP adds two _port numbers_ that identify a connection between two computers.
//
Packets that are part of a connection flow between the computers the same way
at the IP layer, but the port numbers allow TCP to separate connections when
packets arrive at the endpoints.
