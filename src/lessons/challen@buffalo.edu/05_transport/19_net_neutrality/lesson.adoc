title: "What is net neutrality?"
---

Internet connections pass across many cooperating computer networks.
//
Unfortunately, that makes it possible for internet service providers or other
network operators to manipulate connections that utilize their infrastructure.
//
This can take the form of boosting the speed of connections to "friendly"
websites, or degrading connections to "unfriendly" websites.
//
The principle of net neutrality states that internet operators should treat
all traffic the same and not meddle in the middle of the network.
//
This is now the law in the United States, although policies in other countries
vary.
//
However, as net neutrality has become more firmly established service
providers have found other ways to drive traffic towards and away from certain
sites.
