title: "Why discuss a single internet search?"
---

Something as quick and commonplace as a single internet touches many
different parts of the internet.
//
Search requires a connection with other computers, protocols to structure
many types of communication, routing and transport layers to move information
from place to place, naming conventions, document markup, crawling the entire
web to find and rank results, and JavaScript to provide an interactive web
experience.
//
Search also touches on issues of authority (who gets to rank the web?),
security and privacy (who knows about my web search activity?), and identify
(should Google tailor my results to me?).
//
Search is also typically performed using free search engines and leads us to
free web content, raising both economic and participation issues.
//
So a single internet search provides an ideal way to organize our journey.
