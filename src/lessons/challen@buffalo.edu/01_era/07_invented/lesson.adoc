title: "Who owns the internet? Who invented it?"
---

So who invented the internet?
//
Was it really Al Gore?
//
And who owns or controls it?
//
As it turns out, the answer is complicated.
//
The internet emerged as a result of many different technologies and is
administered in a largely-distributed manner.
//
As they say, success has many mothers, and the internet is certainly a
success.
