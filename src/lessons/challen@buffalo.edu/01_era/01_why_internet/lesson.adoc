title: "Why discuss the internet?"
---

The internet is the transformative technology of our age.
//
It defines the era that we live in.
//
And if you are a computer scientist, it represents the crowning achievement of
your field and the platform that will deliver most of your new great ideas.
//
Discussing the internet allows us to survey some of the best contributions of
computer science, learn powerful design principles, and understand the world
around us.
//
Discussing the internet also allows us to consider how it is changing us, and
dream about how we can use it to change our world.
