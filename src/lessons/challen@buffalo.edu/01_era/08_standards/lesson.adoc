title: "How is the internet standardized and documented?"
---

The open spirit of the internet comes through clearly in the way that it is
documented.
//
Internet standards have been distributed through a series of RFC, or
"Requests for Comment".
//
Rather than being a dictate, or mandate, RFCs engage the community in a
constructive discussion about how things should work and invite comment and
collaboration.
