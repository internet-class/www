title: "How do you find out more about the internet?"
---

The internet is probably the easiest thing on earth to find out more about.
//
A lot of information on the internet is directly related to... the internet!
//
(And to computer science in general.)
//
In addition, if you are interested in web protocols the full contents of
every web page and the code it runs are delivered to your browser each time
you load a page and available for inspection.
//
Google around, poke around, try Wikipedia, and you'll find out that you can
easily find out a lot more.
//
Also there are a few good books out there as well that explore topics in more
depth.
