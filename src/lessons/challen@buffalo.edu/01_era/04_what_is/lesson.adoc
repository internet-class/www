title: "Why is the internet?"
---

So what exactly _is_ the internet?
//
As you might expect for something so important and transformative, there's no
single answer to that question.
//
Instead, there are three.
//
The internet is a physical network, governed by protocols, that is used by
billions of people all over the world.
//
When you combine physical connections, protocol cooperation, and
people-generated content, you produce a global phenomenon.
