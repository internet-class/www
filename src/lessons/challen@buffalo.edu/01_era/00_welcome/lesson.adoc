title: "Welcome to the University at Buffalo. And welcome to computer science!"
---

I'm pleased to be one of the first to welcome you to college at the University
at Buffalo.
//
Also congrats on making a very wise choice of major.
//
There's nothing more exciting to study today than computer science--period.
//
The power that these skills can teach you can truly change the world.
//
I'm excited to meet all of you in the weeks and months to come.
//
While I won't be attending class, I will have weekly office hours and I would
love for you to stop by.
//
Good luck settling in at college and please be in touch if you need anything.
