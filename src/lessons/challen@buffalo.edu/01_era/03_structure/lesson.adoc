title: "What is a flipped classroom and why are we trying it?"
---

We're trying a little something different with how this course is structured
at UB.
//
The traditional model is that you come to some lecture hall, someone drones on
for a while, and then you do activities outside of class (also known as
homework).
//
But lectures are pretty boring, and hard to improve incrementally.
//
So we're trying what is known as a _flipped classroom_ model.
//
You are responsible for watching the videos on your own before class, and
we'll make sure you know exactly which ones.
//
Then in class we're going to do a series of interesting (we hope!) activities
to allow you to engage with the material.
//
That's the plan at least.
//
We'll see how it goes.
