title: "What is the difference between the internet, a network, and an intranet?"
---

Three terms come up often when discussing the internet: the internet (of
course), networks, and intranets.
//
Let's get them straight so we don't get confused.
//
An internet is a network of networks.
//
A network is a set of connected computers.
//
And an intranet refers to networked resources that are not exposed to the
public internet.
