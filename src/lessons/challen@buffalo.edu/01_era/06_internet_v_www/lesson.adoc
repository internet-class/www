title: "What is the difference between the World Wide Web and the internet?"
---

Another frequent source of confusion is the difference between the World Wide
Web and the internet.
//
Confusion here is understable, given that so much of what we do online is
done on the web--even when we are using other internet services.
//
Briefly, the World Wide Web is just one of many services that run on the
internet.
//
It defined its own naming conventions (uniform resource locators, or URLs),
protocols (the hypertext transfer protocol, or HTTP), and markup (hypertext
markup language, or HTML).
//
However, the naming, protocols, and markup defined by the WWW are all subsets
of the conventions using on the internet.
//
The easiest way to see the difference is to compare the WWW with another
popular internet service... like email.
