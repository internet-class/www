title: "What is a remix?"
---

As a distribution system for digital media, the internet has supported the
rise of remix culture--sometimes known as read-write culture.
//
In contrast to read-only culture, where users are passive consumers of
content, read-write culture encourages users to engage with content by
creating derivative works.
//
Remixes can take many forms, but a familiar one in the idea of sampling
snippets from other songs or creating music mashups.
//
Whether these derivations constitute fair use has been the subject of a great
deal of debate.
