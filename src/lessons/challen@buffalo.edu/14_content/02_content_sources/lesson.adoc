title: "Where does stuff online come from?"
---

Broadly, we can divide stuff online into two categories: free and non-free.
//
And we can divide content creators into two categories: paid and unpaid.
//
Today, a lot (but not all) of the free content comes from unpaid sources--and
a lot (but not all) of the non-free content comes from paid sources.
//
Of course, it's the exceptions to this rule that are interesting and
disruptive.
//
It's also interesting to explore the degree to which crowdsourced content is
replacing content created by professionals, and the implications of this
shift.
