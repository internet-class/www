title: "What is open-source software?"
---

One of the more interesting models for content creation that accompanied the
birth of the internet is open-source software.
//
In the open-source community, software artifacts are given away for
free--although licensing terms vary.
//
The open-source model provides vibrant proof that there are many different
ways to incentivize people to build and create things--and that money is just
one of them.
//
Even without direct payment, many contributors to the open-source community
are well-compensated, both in fame and fortune.
