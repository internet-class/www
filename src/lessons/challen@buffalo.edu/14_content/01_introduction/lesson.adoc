Where does all the stuff online come from?
//
And who pays for it?
//
The internet has brought huge changes to decades old models of how things
were created and paid for.
//
Important to these changes is the idea of digital representation and copies.
//
Prior to the internet, stealing something meant taking it away from someone
else.
//
Now that we can make perfect copies, that is no longer the case.
//
Easy distribution of perfect digital copies has had important positive
impacts, including open-source software, creative remixing, self-publishing,
and making the overall publishing system much more efficient.
//
Simultaneously, easy distribution of perfect digital copies has created
financial problems for creators, disrupted important sources of information,
and filled the internet with fake or illegal content.
//
This may be the ultimate Pandora's box opened by the internet, and we are
still far from determining how it will turn out.
