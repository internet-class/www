title: "What is digital rights management (DRM)?"
---

Digital rights management (DRM) is some combination of hardware and software
intended to restrict how digital media can be used.
//
The goal is to protect the rights of the copyright holder.
//
For example, DRM might prevent a user from playing a song on a device other
than the one it was purchased on--or from sharing that song with a friend.
//
Unfortunately, many attempts at DRM were easily circumvented, and had a
tendency to inconvenience consumers.
//
And it has been difficult to create digital protection approaches that align
well with our usual expectations about how we can use content that we have
purchased.
