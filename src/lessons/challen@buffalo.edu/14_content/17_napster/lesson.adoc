title: "How did Napster change the music industry?"
---

An early but important example of the tensions created by freely-available
online content was Napster.
//
Napster was a peer-to-peer music-sharing service that enabled the widespread
dissemination of copyrighted content.
//
It's popularity set off an early debate about the relationship between the
internet and the traditional music industry.
//
Critics pointed out that Napster was clearly violating copyright.
//
Supporters, however, pointed out that it was unclear whether this was hurting
or helping music sales by allowing users to find music online that was not
being played on the radio.
//
While Napster was eventually shut down, its effect on the music industry
continues to be felt.
//
Albums are distributed differently, all-you-can-eat music subscriptions have
become more powerful, and touring has become more financially important to
many artists.
