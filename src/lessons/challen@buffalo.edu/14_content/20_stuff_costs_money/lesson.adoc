title: "Remember: good stuff costs money."
---

As you travel the wealth of free content available online, it's good to keep
in mind a basic tenet of economics that the internet has not been able to
change: good stuff costs money.
//
When your favorite band isn't singing, they need to eat and pay the rent.
//
Ditto for your favorite blogger, v-logger, and other online content creators.
//
The good thing is that the internet has made it easier than ever to support
your favorite creators directly, without wasting money on middlemen.
//
So do that.
//
It feels good!
