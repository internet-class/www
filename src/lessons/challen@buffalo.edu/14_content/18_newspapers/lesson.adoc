title: "How has the internet changed the newspaper industry?"
---

The newspaper industry has been greatly changed and challenged by the
emergence of the internet.
//
Early decisions to make a great deal of news content available for free made
it difficult to charge users later.
//
As a result, we now have entire generations that are used to finding free news
online.
//
There's only one problem--good reporting costs money, and good reporting
matters a great deal in a free society.
//
Newspapers will continue to adapt to the internet, and it is unlikely that
paid reporters will ever be replaced by the crowd.
//
But it is far from clear that the internet has, to date, had a positive effect
on news reporting and society's need to know the truth.
