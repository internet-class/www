title: "What kinds of fake content are available online?"
---

The internet has made it easier to publish anything online and make it look
legitimate.
//
Unfortunately, this also includes a variety of things that are either
misleading or intentionally incorrect.
//
Think about it: before the internet, publishing a fake newspaper was
_expensive_.
//
Now it's cheap and easy to make a completely fake online newspaper that can
look almost indistinguishable from a legitimate newspaper.
//
But why would anyone do this?
//
Easy: money.
