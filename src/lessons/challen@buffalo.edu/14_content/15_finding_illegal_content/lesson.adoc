title: "How is illegal or copyrighted content discovered online?"
---

There's a constant cat and mouse game going on online.
//
On one hand, people are constantly posting things online that they should not.
//
On the other, other people and search engines are constantly looking for
copyrighted content and trying to remove it from websites, blogs, and search
results.
//
The process goes on continuously, with no real end in sight.
