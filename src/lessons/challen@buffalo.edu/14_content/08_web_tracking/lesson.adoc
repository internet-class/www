title: "What is web tracking?"
---

Individual sites have always been able to track your internet usage.
//
However, given that ads frequently appear on sites that do not have enough
information to personalize them appropriately, advertisers frequently try to
track users activity across multiple sites to better personalize ad content.
//
You may not like this web tracking, and there are ways to ask advertisers to
stop doing it.
//
On the other hand, you may appreciate seeing more relevant ads on the sites
you visit.
