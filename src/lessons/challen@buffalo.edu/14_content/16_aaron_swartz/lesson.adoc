Aaron Swartz was an internet pioneer.
//
He co-founded Reddit, was active in the open-source software community,
co-authored the original RSS specification, and helped lead the protests that
stopped the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).
//
Unfortunately, Aaron's hacktivism took a tragic turn.
//
He was arrested for illegally distributing academic journal articles that he
gained access to while at MIT.
//
Facing serious criminal charges and in the face of what has been generally
considered to be over-zealous prosecution, Aaron chose to end his own life.
