title: "What is online advertising?"
---

Ads are an important source of revenue for online content creators and
service providers.
//
You've probably noticed them before.
//
They appear next to search engine results, on a variety of different social
networking sites, and in general litter the information superhighway in a way
not dissimilar to the way that billboards litter our literal superhighways.
//
At best, ads are interesting if a bit annoying.
//
At worst, they can cause several usability problems.
//
But the decision of many online sites to offer free content and services has
made them increasingly important to funding the internet.
