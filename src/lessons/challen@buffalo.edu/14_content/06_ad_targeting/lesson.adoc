title: "What is ad targeting?"
---

Online ads have a significant advantage compared with print and other forms
of traditional advertising--they can customize themselves to the viewer.
//
As your browser loads many web pages, ad engines are working to personalize
ad content to you.
//
They use your location, your preferences, products that you may have browsed
recently, and any other information about you that an advertisers thinks will
increase your tendency to click on the ad.
