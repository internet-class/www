When we talk about online content two terms that come up are the _deep_ and
_dark_ web.
//
The _deep web_ is all of the content not found by search engines.
//
This content is frequently invisible because it is behind some kind of
authorization system (your email) or trapped in a specialized online
ecosystem (large parts of Facebook).
//
But you can access this content using a normal web browser.
//
In contrast, content on the _dark web_ requires special software to access.
//
The dark web contains a lot of content that would be illegal or dangerous to
distribute on the public web: drugs, malicious hacking tools, or content
released by government whistleblowers.
