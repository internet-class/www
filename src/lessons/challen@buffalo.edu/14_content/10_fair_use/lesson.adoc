title: "What is fair use?"
---

The internet has raised many questions about what it is permissible to do
with copyrighted content.
//
A way to anchor these conversations is through the existing legal doctrine of
_fair use_.
//
Fair use provides a way to use limited amounts of copyrighted material for
certain purposes without acquiring the rights from the copyright owner.
//
Fair use was designed to provide a counterbalance to the significant rights
of copyright holders, and to allow important kinds of scholarship and reuse
to occur outside of the bounds of copyright law.
