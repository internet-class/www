title: "What are micropayments?"
---

The revenue model for many online content providers is currently based on
advertising.
//
But it doesn't have to be that way.
//
One alternative is for users to either sign up for subscriptions, but that
may only be suitable for frequent--not casual--visitors.
//
Another interesting alternative relies on _micropayments_.
//
Each time you visit a site, your browser could automatically pay the owner
some small amount of money--either with or without prompting the user.
//
Content creators would get paid by users, without having to litter their
sites with obtrusive advertising.
