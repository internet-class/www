title: "What is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)?"
---

As the internet has matured, legislation has played an increasingly important
role in determining what ends up online.
//
An important piece of early internet copyright legislation is the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), passed in 1998.
//
The DMCA is known for several provisions.
//
One criminalizes attempts to circumvent digital rights management (DRM) access
control measures.
//
Another provides a mechanism&mdash;known as a _takedown notice_&mdash;allowing
copyright owners to request that copyrighted content made available illegally
online be removed.
//
The DMCA also provides safe harbor provisions exempting websites and internet
service providers from liability if their users post copyrighted material.
//
The DMCA has been criticized repeatedly since its inception, mainly by groups
concerned with its chilling effects on consumer freedoms, competition, and
free speech.
