title: "What are ad blockers?"
---

Wherever there is offense, there is also defense.
//
To fight back against sites full of ads, most modern web browsers allow users
to install ad blocking extensions.
//
These extensions try to detect and block content from sites known to serve
advertising content.
//
Ad blockers can make browsing the web a much more enjoyable experience.
//
But as more users have installed ad blockers, sites have begun to fight back
by either refusing service to or complaining about users with ad blocking
software installed.
//
This reflects an economic reality of the modern internet--ads are important
source of revenue for many sites that provide free content.
