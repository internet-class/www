title: "What was the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA)?"
---

In 2011 the US government tried to enact more sweeping online copyright
protections.
//
The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) would have provided copyright holders with
new and more powerful mechanism for restricting access to websites that posted
copyrighted content.
//
Ad networks could be prevented from working with infringing sites, search
engines could have been forced to remove them from search results, and
internet service providers could have been forced to block their users from
accessing them.
//
Opponents, however, found many aspects of the bill to criticize, particularly
its limits on free speech and the way that it would enable and even require
internet censorship.
//
Despite bipartisan support, after online protests led by many prominent
websites, the bill was shelved.
