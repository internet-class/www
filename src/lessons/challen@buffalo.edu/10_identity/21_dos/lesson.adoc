title: "What is a denial of service (DoS) attack?"
---

A common way to try to disable a website or web service is known as a _denial
of service (DoS) attack_.
//
A denial of service attack occurs when the attacker can overwhelm a website
with illegitimate requests to the point where it cannot handle legitimate
ones.
//
How the website and web server are designed impacts the degree to which DoS
attacks succeed or fail.
