title: "What is the Tails OS?"
---

For the privacy-concerned--or the paranoid--Tails OS may be a good way to
protect yourself online.
//
Tails boots off of a USB stick and leaves no trace of itself once powered
down.
//
All internet connections are forced to use the Tor network, and a variety of
other security- and privacy-conscious decisions have been made and software
tools installed.
