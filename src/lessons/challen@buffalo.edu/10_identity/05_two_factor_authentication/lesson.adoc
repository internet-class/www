title: "What is two-factor authentication?"
---

Increasing security concerns and the demonstrated difficulty that humans have
with passwords have led to the widespread deployment of _two-factor
authentication_.
//
Two factor authentication systems vary, but the basic principle is the same:
to combine something you _know_ with something you _have_.
//
Something you know could be a password, and something you have could be your
smartphone.
//
Properly deployed, two-factor authentication systems can be more secure that
standard password-based approaches.
//
That's because even if a data breach reveals your username and password, it
doesn't give a hacker access to your personal phone.
