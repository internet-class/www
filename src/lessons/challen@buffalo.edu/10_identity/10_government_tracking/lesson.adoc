title: "How can the government track you online?"
---

Websites already can and do record a great deal about your interaction with
their site.
//
But the government is a much stronger adversary and has the ability to monitor
a lot more of your online activity.
//

but we can use our imagination to conjure up what they _could_ do,
particularly if they are targeting a certain person for whatever reason.
