title: "What is online privacy?"

Given that much of what we do online is tracked, what does the term online
privacy even mean?

Depending on who the adversary is, this can be straightforward or incredibly
daunting.
//
Luckily for individual users, strong encryption offers a way to establish
privacy in certain cases and keep our online activities unmonitored.
