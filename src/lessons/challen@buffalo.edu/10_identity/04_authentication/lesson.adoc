title: "What is authentication?"
---

One of the most common ways to establish your identity online is through the
process of authentication.
//
Authentication can and frequently is used for access control--to ensure that
only certain users have access to certain systems or capabilities.
//
But it does this by having users establish their _identity_ in a way that can
be retrieve information about them or the roles and capabilities they have on
a particular system.
//
So part of our online identity is the sets of username and password
combinations we use to access certain sites.
