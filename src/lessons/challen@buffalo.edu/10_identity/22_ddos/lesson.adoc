title: "What is a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack?"
---

It is difficult for a single site to generate enough traffic to launch an
effective denial of service (DoS) attack.
//
Large spikes in traffic are also easy for sites to detect and defend against.
//
So instead of using a single attacking node, denial of service attacks are
often launched by a bunch of computers acting together.
//
This is referred to as a _distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack_.
//
Because attackers do not usually have legitimate access to a sufficient number
of machines to launch a DDoS, frequently groups of hacked machines referred to
as _botnets_ are used.
