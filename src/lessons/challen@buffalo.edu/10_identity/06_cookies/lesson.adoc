title: "What is a browser cookie?"
---

Many authentication schemes require that the browser retain a small piece of
information about the user--known as an _HTTP cookie_.
//
While cookies are often used for authentication, they can be used to record
stateful information about a user session, like shopping cart contents.
//
They can also be used to track users over multiple visits to the same website,
although this use has caused concern and led to new warnings on sites that you
may have noticed.
