title: "What can and do websites track about you?"
---

Websites can and do record a variety of information about you as you use them.
//
Anything that generates a HTTP request can be recorded, and modern browsers
typically send along a variety of information that can be used to identify the
browser and operating system.
//
In some cases user IP address can be used to at least identify a
coarse-grained location.
//
How much information sites actually retain is a function of how valuable the
information is and how they plan on using it.
