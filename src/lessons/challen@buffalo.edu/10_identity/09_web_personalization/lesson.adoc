title: "How do websites personalize content for you?"
---

One of the main reasons that many websites track information about you is to
try and personalize the content on the page.
//
In many cases, this means personalized ads, but shopping sites may use the
data more directly.
//
You may consider personalization to be harmless.
//
Or you may consider it to be warping your experience of the internet.
//
A lot of it depends on what information about you is collected and how it is
used.
