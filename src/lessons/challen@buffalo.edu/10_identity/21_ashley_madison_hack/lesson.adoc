title: "What was the Ashley Madison hack?"
---

One of the more widely-publicized data breaches in recent memory was the
release of the identities of Ashley Madison users.
//
Ashley Madison claimed to be able to arrange hook ups between married
individuals.
//
When their account information was released, it led to a few surprises.
//
Not only were the identities of many people--mostly men--that were attempting
to initiate extramarital affairs reveals, but it was also discovered that most
of the female profiles on the site were fake.
//
Sad!
//
Actually, doubly sad!
