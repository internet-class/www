title: "What is an online identity?"
---

Our online identities are quite distinct from our actual human identities.
//
In some cases the internet doesn't know anything about us, and so we are
invisible online.
//
In other cases, our human names don't identify us well online, and so our
identities begin to merge with others with identical names.
//
In other cases, even if we can be uniquely identified, the information that
the internet "knows" about us is incomplete--or worse, inaccurate.
//
Like any human acquaintance, how the internet knows us is a function of what
it knows about us.
