title: "What is metadata?"
---

An important term that has emerged in the debate surrounding online privacy
and government tracking is _metadata_.
//
Metadata is used to refer to information about a particular set of
communications that is _not_ the content of those communications.
//
So the subject line of an email, rather than its contents.
//
Or the location that a text message was sent, rather than its contents.
//
While metadata seems like it might be safer to collect, it can still be used
to uncover information about individuals that could constitute a violation of
privacy.
