title: "Why is an IP address not an identity?"
---

When we exchange data online an internet protocol (IP) address identifies our
machine so that it can communicate with other computers.
//
But, for a variety of reasons, that IP address doesn't necessarily identify
us.
//
Although it can in certain cases.
