title: "What is the Golden Shield?"
---

China provides a great example of how governments can control and monitor the
way that their citizens access the internet.
//
The Golden Shield refers to a collection of techniques used by the Chinese
government to monitor and restrict internet access within the country.
//
Certain sites are blocked entirely, while other sites (including search
engines) may have their transmissions altered to remove certain results.
//
In some cases China actually launches man-in-the-middle attacks on secure
connections through forged site certificates.
//
Although a variety of techniques exist allowing technical sophisticates to
bypass some of these restrictions, they are likely succeeding in controlling
access to the internet for many Chinese citizens.
