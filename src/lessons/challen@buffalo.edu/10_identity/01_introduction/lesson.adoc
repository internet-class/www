title: "Introduction to internet identity."
---

Who are you online?
//
And does that identity bear any resemblance to the person you are in the real
world?
//
As more and more of our personal lives are lived online, the question of what
is an internet identity and how we shape it are becoming more important.
//
The internet and the web can be a great way to share things about our lives
with others.
//
But the same system can also violate our privacy when information that we
would prefer to keep private makes its way online.
//
At that point it can be very hard to recover.
//
To talk about identity we have to discuss authentication, typically used to
establish your identity online.
//
We'll also discuss what sites track about you and what happens when that
information gets out unintentionally.
