title: "What is artificial intelligence?"
---

Today, most of the intelligence online is in one way or another generated by
humans.
//
Tomorrow, we may find ourselves interacting with increasingly intelligent
computers.
//
And, given the computational resources required to operate such creations,
we're sure to find them online first.
//
Alan Turing designed his Turing Test to determine whether computers had
achieved a level of intelligence allowing them to impersonate a human.
//
In the future, we might just find machines passing it.
