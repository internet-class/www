title: "What was the analytical engine?"
---

One of the first visions of what would become the computer was Charles
Babbage's analytical engine.
//
While the design for his mechanical computer was never realized, he is still
considered the father of the modern computer.
//
And his designs were furthered through a long-running correspondence with
Countess Ada Lovelace, who is widely considered the first computer
programmer.
//
She not only helped explain Babbage's creation, but also described what is
considered the first computer algorithm that could have run on the analytical
engine.
//
Although they operate very differently, Babbage's vision found realization in
the computers we use today.
