title: "What is Bitcoin?"
---

Today, the value of currencies is based on national power.
//
Tomorrow, cryptocurrencies that are based on cryptography may provide an
alternate source of wealth and exchange that can operate independently of a
central bank or authority.
//
The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, which is already used as a
medium of exchange by many online--particularly on the dark web.
//
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are undoubtedly the precursor to major
changes in the banking and finance industries brought about by the internet.
//
In the future banking will be different, although it's not clear how just
yet.
