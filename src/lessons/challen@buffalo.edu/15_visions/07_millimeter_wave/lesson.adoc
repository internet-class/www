title: "What is millimeter-wave networking?"
---

Today our wireless internet connections are fast.
//
But tomorrow they could be even faster.
//
In a search for ever more bandwidth, today researchers are experimenting with
wireless technologies that use much higher frequencies than today's Wifi and
cellular networks.
//
So-called millimeter-wave networks promise dramatic improvements in wireless
performance.
//
There's only one catch--millimeter-wave signals are highly-attenuated by many
objects and propagate much more similarly to visible light.
//
So building practical networks that can deliver signals to mobile devices
presents many engineering challenges.
