Today computers represent and manipulate data in binary bits: 1s and 0s.
//
Tomorrow, they may be able to directly represent uncertainty by manipulating
quantum-mechanical states.
//
In a quantum computer, a qubit can represent any one of many possible states
with fluctuating probability.
//
While quantum computing is still in its infancy, if realized quantum
computers may be able to solve certain problems _much_ more quickly than
today's computers.
//
For example, algorithms exists allowing quantum computers to quickly perform
integer factorization, which could challenge the basis for most modern
cryptosystems.
