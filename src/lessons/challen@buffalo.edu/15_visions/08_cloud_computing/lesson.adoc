title: "What is cloud computing?"
---

Today we are already witnessing cloud computing changing the role of
user-facing devices.
//
End-user devices--from laptops to embedded device--can easily tap into
seemingly limitless computational and storage resources in the internet
cloud.
//
While the cloud seems new, in a way it speaks to a past vision of thin-client
computing in which "dumb terminals" would get their smarts by connecting to
all-powerful backend infrastructure.
//
The rise of powerful personal computers delayed this vision by a few decades,
but it's possible that in the future most of the computing power will be
located in data centers.
//
All we'll be carrying around will be just glorified monitors and input
devices.
