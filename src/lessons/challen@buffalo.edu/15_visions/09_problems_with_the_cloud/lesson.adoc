title: "What are some problems with cloud computing?"
---

We are living through the dawn of cloud computing.
//
But some of the clouds are dark ones.
//
Latency to cloud infrastructure remains a problem for many interactive apps
and services.
//
The security of data in the cloud requires an intentionally amorphous set of
entities and infrastructure.
//
And the cloud still struggles at times to provide reliability guarantees.
//
At times, the cloud should still remind us of Leslie Lamport's definition of
a distributed system: "a system where I can't get my work done because a
computer has failed that I've never even heard of."
