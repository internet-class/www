title: "What is the semantic web?"
---

Today web content exists largely for human consumption, and as a result in a
semi-structured form.
//
Tomorrow, we may see the emergence of even more structured web content that
makes the web easier for machines to understand and more like a distributed
database.
//
Take, for example, the sentence: "Geoffrey Challen started working at UB in
2011."
//
To a human, this sentence represents a relationship between two entities
(Geoffrey Challen and UB) and a fact about that relationship (started in
2011).
//
However, a computer might find this description hard to parse without
sophisticated natural language processing.
//
In the future, next-generation semantic web technologies may help structure
this relationship more clearly using additional markup.
