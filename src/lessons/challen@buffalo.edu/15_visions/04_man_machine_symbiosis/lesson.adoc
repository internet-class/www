In 1960, J.C.R. Licklider extended Bush's vision further in describing
systems that would enable man-machine symbiosis.
//
Licklider described man-machine symbiosis as enabling "men and computers to
cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations".
//
Much of the early interest in such systems came out of the military, which
encountered many complex situations that they needed help controlling.
//
The internet has enabled many such systems.
//
Bloomberg terminals and car navigation systems are just two examples of
systems allowing humans and computers to work together to control complex
situations.
//
Even self-driving cars still need a human to tell them where to go.
