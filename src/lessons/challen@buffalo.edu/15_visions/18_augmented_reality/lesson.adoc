title: "What is augmented reality?"
---

Today our virtual and physical world must coexist loosely side-by-side.
//
But tomorrow they may be intermingle right in front of our eyes.
//
For example, if I want to learn how to install a door, today I watch a video
and then try to project the advice into the space I am working in.
//
Tomorrow, with the aid of augmented reality technologies, I may be able to
see advice, tips, and useful information projected right on the materials I
am working with.
//
This will usher in a powerful shift in the ways that the information online
and our physical experience of reality coexist.
//
In the future, it is clear that the internet will become even more directly a
part of our real world.
