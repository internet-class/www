title: "What is web assembly?"
---

Today web programming is limited to JavaScript.
//
Tomorrow we'll probably see something different.
//
Web assembly aims to break JavaScript's monopoly on the browser using an
old-fashioned approach.
//
Rather than using a single interpreted language (JavaScript), web programs
could be written in any language and then compiled down into (web) assembly
code that would run in the browser.
//
In the future, it's unlikely that JavaScript will maintain its hold on
frontend web development.
//
But it had a great run.
