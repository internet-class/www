Now we know what the internet is.
//
But what will it become?
//
To approach this question, we'll start by revisiting past visions of what the
internet could become and see how they have been (or have not been) realized.
//
Then we'll look at the future of various parts of the internet, from
connectivity to protocols to security to identity.
//
At the end, we'll come back to the question of what the web is becoming and
how we are involved.
//
As Frank Bidart very beautifully put it, "We fill pre-existing forms and when
we fill them change them and are changed."
