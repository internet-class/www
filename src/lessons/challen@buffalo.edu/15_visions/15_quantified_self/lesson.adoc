title: "What is the quantified self?"
---

Today most of what the internet knows about us is limited to what we tell it.
//
Tomorrow, an increase in the number of sensors that we attach to ourselves
and surround ourselves with may provide rich new data streams for internet
services to consume.
//
One term for this movement is the _quantified self_.
//
At its best, it represents an earlier ideal that what can be measured can be
understood and potentially improved.
//
However, at least today the links between more data and better outcomes
remain tenuous.
//
But in the future data collected from sensors mounted on and inside of us may
allow the internet to care for us when we are sick, recommend what to eat,
and generally help us take better care of our fragile human selves.
