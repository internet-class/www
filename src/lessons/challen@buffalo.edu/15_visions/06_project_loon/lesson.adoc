title: "What is Project Loon?"
---

Today, around half the world still lacks internet access.
//
Tomorrow, everyone will be connected.
//
One interesting effort to provide wide area but slow internet access is
Project Loon at Google.
//
Like many similar efforts, it avoids thorny and expensive infrastructure
problems by beaming internet down from the sky.
//
Whether from balloons or lazily-orbiting planes, billions of people might
receive their first internet access as a literal gift from above.
