title: "Goodbye, and good luck."
---

It's been a great pleasure teaching you this term.
//
I hope a bit of the excitement and joy I feel about the internet has rubbed
off on you.
//
I'll use this opportunity to thank the course staff, including the fantastic
undergraduate teaching assistants.
//
None of this would have been possible without them.
//
And I want to say a special word of thanks to Greg Bunyea, the head
undergraduate teaching assistant.
//
This would _definitely_ not have been possible with him.
