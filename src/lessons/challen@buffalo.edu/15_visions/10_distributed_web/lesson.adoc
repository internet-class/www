title: "What is the fully-distributed web?"
---

Today, almost all of our online interactions follow the client-server model,
with the cloud emerging as the ultimate and all-powerful server.
//
But a new generation of internet and web technologies are challenging this
architecture.
//
It has always been possible to build a fully-distributed web and internet, in
which all currently centralized functions would be delegated to a shifting
set of machines.
//
To some degree, the cloud is already accomplishing this, as did earlier
generations of peer-to-peer systems.
//
But there are serious efforts underway to bring such a fully-distributed web
to fruition.
//
Perhaps tomorrow we will all be part of the cloud?
