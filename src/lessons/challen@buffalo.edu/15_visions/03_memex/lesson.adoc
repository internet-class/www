title: "What was the memex?"
---

In 1945 Vannevar Bush described a computer system very similar to today's
modern internet in a seminal article in the Atlantic Monthly entitled "As We
May Think".
//
He called his creation the _memex_.
//
Bush imagined the memex as a device that would function as a supplement to
our own faulty and limited memory.
//
We would use it to store all of our books and communications, and it would
allow us to summon them at will.
//
Although the internet evolved features that Bush did not anticipate, his
vision found realization in the web we use today.
//
Particularly in the search engines which allow us to retrieve information so
quickly and easily.
