title: "What is the read-write internet?"
---

Sir Tim Berners-Lee imagined the web as a place where people would both
encounter and share content.
//
But at some point internet content became very one-directional: a read-only
internet that resembled a somewhat more interactive form of existing
broadcast media like television.
//
However, the vision of a read-write internet lives on in certain ways.
//
YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and other sites that allow users to share
content have resulted in an explosion of sharing and creating, despite the
limitations inherent to these platforms.
//
And of course Wikipedia probably represents the ultimate realization of the
read-write internet, as millions of users collaborate to create an online
encyclopedia.
//
But you can expect selling and sharing to continue to duel it out online for
the foreseeable future.
