title: "What should the internet become?"
---

The internet is a set of technologies.
//
It is not trying to become anything--rather, it reflects a mixture of the
many visions of those that created and continue to use it.
//
So what the internet _should_ become is ultimately a very personal question.
//
What do you think it should become?
//
Fifty years from now, how would you like the internet--and computing
generally--to be different?
//
What do you think is wrong with the internet we have today, and how should we
fix it?
//
The answers to these questions matter because you are one of the people that
will shape the internet's destiny.
