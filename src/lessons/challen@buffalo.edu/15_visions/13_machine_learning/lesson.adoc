title: "What is machine learning?"
---

The expansion of the semantic web along with more powerful artificial
intelligence techniques may have a unique effect on so-called machine
learning.
//
Machine learning is a subset of AI that focuses on allowing computers to more
effectively learn and generalized from data.
//
As the amount of data online increases, and becomes more structured, this
should improve the power of existing and new machine learning techniques.
//
Tomorrow's robots may not need to be display artificial intelligence,
assuming that they can learn enough from all the data we'll be able to
provide them.
