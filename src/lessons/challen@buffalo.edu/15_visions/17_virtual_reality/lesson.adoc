title: "What is virtual reality?"
---

Today cyberspace exists on our screens.
//
Tomorrow it may be plastered right on our eyeballs.
//
Virtual reality technologies attempt to immerse us in a virtual world that
today coexists with the actual physical world.
//
Rather than seeing a representation of a virtual world on a screen, virtual
reality headsets allow us to see it first hand.
//
In the future it is clear that technology will provide ever more immersive
ways to get lost in cyberspace.
