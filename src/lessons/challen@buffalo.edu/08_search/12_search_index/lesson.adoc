title: "What is a search index?"
---

The goal of crawling the web and analyzing page contents is to construct a
search _index_.
//
An search index is not altogether different than the index of a book.
//
Book indexes map key terms to pages on which those terms appear or are
discussed.
//
Search indexes map search terms to web pages on which those terms appear.
//
However, multiple important differences distinguish book indexes from web
search indexes.
//
First, the web is constantly changing, so indexes must be automatically
created and updated.
//
Second, search engines must be prepared for users to search for anything and
build indexes accordingly.
