title: "Why distribute computing?"
---

Distributing computation across many different machines creates a lot of
challenges.

So why not just build a single computer with enough storage to hold the
entire internet and powerful enough to search the whole internet quickly?
//
The answer involves a small diversion into computer hardware, as well as some
interesting lessons about the tradeoffs between cost, complexity, and
reliability in computer systems.
