title: "Overview of a single internet search."
---

Let's review everything that has to happen for you to perform a single
internet search.
//
First, all of the billions of web pages have to be found and processed.
//
That processing has to prepare the search engine to reply to any possible
search.
//
Second, the relative importance of various pages has to be established.
//
Search engines use many different factors to determine how to rank results,
but at the most basic level some pages are better than others--more
reputable or more useful.
//
Finally, the search engine has to receive your search, locate all relevant
pages, rank them, and return the results.
//
Amazingly, this entire process happens in a fraction of a second.
