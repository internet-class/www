title: "What is the internet archive?"
---

The web is changing constantly.
//
Pages move and disappear, and page contents change.
//
But the web at any moment in time is a piece of our collective history.
//
Viewing old pages can be interesting, and at times can uncover information
that some would prefer to keep hidden.
//
Happily the Internet Archive project is actively archiving the internet and
creating a historical record of how it has evolved.
