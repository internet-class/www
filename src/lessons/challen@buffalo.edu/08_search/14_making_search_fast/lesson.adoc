title: "How do we make search fast?"
---

To be useful, web search has to be fast.
//
Really fast web search makes interactive and adaptive search styles possible.
//
Making search fast gets harder as the web gets larger, which it has been.
//
At the same time, web search has become faster.
//
At the heart of fast and efficient web search are both clever algorithms and
a lot of careful systems engineering.
