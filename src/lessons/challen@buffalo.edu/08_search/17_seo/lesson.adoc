title: "What is search engine optimization (SEO)?"
---

The broad category of ways that sites attempt to improve their rankings is
known as _search engine optimization_, or SEO.
//
SEO is sometimes broken into two categories.
//
Black hat SEO consists of manipulative strategies that search engine
providers do not condone and actively defend against.
//
In contrast, white hat SEO consists of a variety of techniques that can
improve the way that a page is processed by search engines and ensure that
search results are relevant.
//
Search providers typically support white hat SEO since its collective effect
is to improve the overall quality of search results.
//
Many white hat SEO techniques consist of various ways to restructure the
page's HTML to ensure that its contents can be properly indexed and its key
topics determined.
