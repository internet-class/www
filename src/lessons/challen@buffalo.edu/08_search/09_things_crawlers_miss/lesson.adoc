title: "What do web crawlers miss?"
---

Web crawlers find a lot of the web, but not necessarily everything.
//
Pages get missed for a variety of reasons.
//
Sometimes there are no links to them.
//
Other times accessing them requires permissions that the robot crawler
doesn't have.
//
And well-behaved web crawlers will also ignore pages if told to be the
website in the form of a `robots.txt` file.
