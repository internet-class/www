title: "What is the right to be forgotten?"
---

Search engines are great for finding things on the web.
//
But what if they are finding things that you don't want to be found?
//
And what if those things include negative content about you that is either
old or untrue?
//
It can be difficult to impossible to remove the offending content from the
web.
//
But a growing movement makes it seem like it may be possible--or
easier--someday soon to at least remove these kind of things from search
results.
//
After all: if nobody can find something, does it really exist?
