Today search is a fundamental part of the internet.
//
All of the content on the web wouldn't be very useful if you couldn't find
anything.
//
Search is also a fascinating story.
//
It requires tens or hundreds of thousands of machines that must work together
and perform well despite constant failures and disruptions.
//
It requires clever and novel algorithms to find, index, and rank everything,
while withstanding attempts to manipulate search results.
//
It requires understanding web page content and estimating the _significance_
of a particular page to a search user.
//
Search also touches on issues of fairness, reputation, spam, and online
permanence.
//
All of this comes together everything time you search online--and it all
works remarkably well.
