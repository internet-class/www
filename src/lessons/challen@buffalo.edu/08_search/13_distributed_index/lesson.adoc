title: "How are search indexes distributed?"
---

Search indexes for the web are far too large to be efficiently stored on a
single machine.
//
As a result, search indexes are distributed across multiple machines.
//
In turn, this means that web searches must access multiple machines to return
a complete set of results.
//
Optimizing this interaction is one of the many challenges to making web
search fast.
